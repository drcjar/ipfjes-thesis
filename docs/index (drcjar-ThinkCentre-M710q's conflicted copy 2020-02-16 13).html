<!-- This is the abstract -->
<p>The question of whether occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognized cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises because it is clinically and epidemiologically plausible, and consistent with fibre studies, case-control, and toxicological data. This thesis examines the question by means of a literature review and a novel hospital based case-control study, the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).</p>
<p>In a literature review and meta-analysis of studies reporting on occupational exposures in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) I found significant associations with metal, wood, and stone dust, but not asbestos. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and confidence in the meta-analysis result is tempered by a high risk for bias arising from selection, lack of blinding, exposure missclassification, incomplete exposure data, and selective reporting of exposures, in the studies considered. In a mortality analysis I found that the incidence of IPF continues to rise and appears to be correlated with mesothelioma mortality. I did not find clear evidence of an association between IPF, pleural mesothelioma, and asbestosis at a regional level.</p>
<p>In a critical review of methods for assessing occupational asbestos exposure I found support for the use of a job exposure matrix based on proportional mortality rates for mesothelioma and validated by quantification of asbestos fibre lung burden. I also found support for using a structured interview tool to provide a quanitative estimate of previous exposure which was validated using historic and simulated exposure data.</p>
<p>In a review of MUC5b and IPF I found evidence supporting a common MUC5b driven pulmonary fibrosis endotype and a candidate mechanism for occupational asbestos exposure contributing to this; alvelolar machrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation resulting in increased IL-1 beta driven airway MUC5b expression.</p>
<p>Occupational asbestos exposure alone was not associated with IPF in IPFJES. It was associated with dyspnoea independant of smoking and case status. It was associated with IPF in participants who also had smoking exposure and the strength of this association was greater for partciipants with the minor allele of MUC5b promotor variant and when a stricter case definition (definite UIP rather than definite UIP or possible UIP) was used.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that occupational asbestos exposure in smokers, coupled with genetic susceptibility factors, may be an important cause of IPF.</p>

<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2016 was the recorded cause of death for approximately 5000 people in England and Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5% per annum in the period 1979-2016.<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2011">[1]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2019">[2]</span> The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).<span class="citation" data-cites="Maher2012">[3]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[4]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Spagnolo2014">[5]</span> The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2011">[1]</span>, patterns that are not unique to the UK.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[4]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hutchinson2014">[6]</span> The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1998">[7]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Vancheri2010">[8]</span></p>
<p>These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.<span class="citation" data-cites="Barber2015">[9]</span> Clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings in asbestosis and IPF are similar<span class="citation" data-cites="Corrin1985">[10]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Copley2003">[11]</span>. Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with ‘IPF’ and revision of the diagnosis to ‘asbestosis’.<span class="citation" data-cites="Monso1990">[12]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Monso1991">[13]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Glazer2009">[14]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ghio2014">[15]</span> MUC5b is the dominant constituent of the honeycomb cysts that characterise the pattern of lung scarring, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is seen in both IPF and asbestosis. The strongest risk factor identified in IPF to date, the MUC5b promotor variant rs35705950 results in increased airway expression of MUC5b<span class="citation" data-cites="Seibold2013">[16]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span> and is also associated with increased risk of asbestosis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Platenburg2020">[18]</span> Toxicological studies have shown that asbestos exposure also results in production of IL-1beta, a key proinflammatory cytokine in IPF and a potent stimulus for MUC5b expression.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dostert2008">[19]</span></p>
<p>Establishing whether occupational asbestos fibre exposure is an under-recognised cause of IPF is an important step towards an understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and might impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would provide an additional data source to inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.</p>
<h2 id="aims-and-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Aims and objectives</h2>
<p>My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950).</p>
<p>My specific research questions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is there an association between occupational asbestos exposure and IPF?</li>
<li>Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF?</li>
<li>Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-sources"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Data sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the literature review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures in IPF I use Medline and Embase and consider all published IPF case-control and cohort studies reporting on occupational exposures.</li>
<li>For the mortality analysis I use data obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Health and Safety Executive, and the World Health Organisation Mortality Database.</li>
<li>For brief reviews of asbestos exposure assessment and genetic susceptibility in IPF I rely on the published literature.</li>
<li>Primary case-control data collected during my PhD as part of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) is used to analyze asbestos exposure in IPF.</li>

<h2 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is made in the presence of a usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern on high resolution CT scan or biopsy. The diagnosis requires that known causes of interstitial lung disease (such as drug toxicity, connective tissue disease, domestic, and occupational or environmental exposures) be excluded.<span class="citation" data-cites="Travis2013">[20]</span></p>
<p>Attributing a disease process to a specific exposure can be difficult. Disease processes are frequently complex or multifactorial, depending on the interaction of genetic and environmental components. Well-studied and relatively frequent entities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes lend themselves to epidemiologic investigation, delineating the major risk factors for disease and their relative contributions to risk at the population level. IPF presents an additional challenge to attribution; because of its relative infrequency, epidemiologic study of the disease is largely limited to case-control studies.<span class="citation" data-cites="Reynolds2017">[21]</span> Studying specific occupational exposures also presents its own challenges; co-exposure is common, occupational hygiene data are frequently limited and self-reported exposure is prone to recall bias.</p>
<p>I identified several review articles of the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease that do not necessarily focus on IPF and only briefly mention occupational factors (e.g Ley2013<span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[4]</span>). Here I consider review articles that specifically deal with occupational factors in IPF and cite the case-control studies used.</p>
<p>Turner-Warwick (1998) discusses potential difficulties in establishing attribution and causality in IPF. She observes that there is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied to exclude IPF; some clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential cause is identified, others only when there is clear exposure to an established cause. She explains that diagnosis based on radiologic and clinical findings, and not on lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage, may result in initiating agents for disease being overlooked. Further, that exposures to agents such as asbestos, silica, coal, graphite, hard metal, and avian proteins, may result in disease that can not be differentiated from IPF.<span class="citation" data-cites="Turner-Warwick1998">[22]</span></p>
<p>Reviewing the epidemiology of IPF and case-control studies to date, Hubbard (2001) describes the association of IPF with occupational exposures to metal and wood and estimates that 10% of IPF cases may be due to occupational metal exposure and 5% of cases to wood.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2001">[23]</span></p>
<p>Taskar and Coultas (2006) review and carry out a meta-analysis of six case-control studies investigating environmental and occupational exposures in IPF. They report population attributable risk percentages for agriculture and farming (20.8%), livestock (4.1%), wood dust (5%), metal dust (3.4%), stone/sand/silica (3.5%), and smoking (49.1%).<span class="citation" data-cites="Taskar2006">[24]</span></p>
<p>Gulati and Redlich’s (2015) review of exposures causing UIP highlights that asbestosis may appear indistinguishable from IPF and summarises previous case-control studies but did not pool studies to perform a meta-analysis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gulati2015">[25]</span></p>
<p>I sought to identify and meta-analyze all IPF case-control studies dealing with occupational exposures. This work contributed to a joint ERS-ATS taskforce on the occupational burden of non-malignant respiratory disease.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanc2019">[26]</span></p>
<h2 id="method"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>I searched Pubmed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases for combinations of the terms ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’, ‘occupation’, ‘case-control study’ and synonyms. My search included all publications published from the respective database start dates until September 2018. When I identified a relevant paper I also reviewed the references and papers citing the paper. I also used Medline ranker<span class="citation" data-cites="Fontaine2009">[27]</span> and bespoke Pubmed ‘mining’ techniques that I developed.<span class="citation" data-cites="Reynolds2017pubmed">[28]</span></p>
<p>A colleague independently reviewed and abstracted data for five exposure categories common to the identified case-control studies: “vapors, gases, dusts, and/or fumes (VGDF)”, “metal dust”, “wood dust”, “silica dust”, and “agricultural dust”. I calculated population attributable fraction (PAF) as follows: PAF=pc(OR - 1)/OR, where pc is the proportion of cases exposed and OR is the risk estimate.</p>
<p>I tabulated study control and case definitions and exposure measures and assessed the risk of bias using RoB-SPEO<span class="citation" data-cites="Pega2020">[29]</span>, a tool for assessing risk of bias in studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to occupational risk factors.</p>
<p>I calculated pooled OR and pooled PAF for occupational exposures using a random effects model in Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). I selected a random effects, rather than fixed effects, model because there were significant differences in study design and populations between studies. The pooled PAF relied on the ratio of attributable cases to all cases underlying each risk estimate.</p>
<h2 id="results"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>I found (as of September 2018) one cohort and 14 case-control studies looking at occupational exposures in IPF; the most recent review article<span class="citation" data-cites="Gulati2015">[25]</span> covers only eight of them. Associations with metal, wood, silica, and agricultural dust were reported. <span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[30]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[31]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996a">[32]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Mullen1998">[33]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[34]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[35]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[36]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Pinheiro2008">[38]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-SanchoFigueroa2010">[39]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-Sancho2011">[40]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Awadalla2012">[41]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[42]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Ekstrom2014">[43]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[44]</span> One study<span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[42]</span> was included even though it was only available as an abstract at the time of analysis because I knew the full text paper was forthcoming.<span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2018">[45]</span> Figures 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are adapted from Blanc et al 2019.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanc2019">[26]</span></p>

</figure>
<p>There was considerable heterogeneity in case-control studies of occupational exposure in IPF, for example, I<sup>2</sup> = 95% for the six studies reporting general (vapours, gas, dust and fume) occupational respiratory exposures<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanc2019">[26]</span> and to a lesser extent for wood, metal and stone dust. See Figures 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. This may be due to real clinical differences in the populations studied or due to chance, publication bias, or methodolgical issues. To investigate possible publication bias I looked for funnel plot assymetry using data from the ERS/ATS taskforce metanalysis<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanc2019">[26]</span>. I found evidence of publication bias for VGDF, and metal dust ((Egger’s test p = 0.04) but not for wood dust (Egger’s test p = 0.1) and not for agricultural dust (Egger’s test p = 0.58).</p>
<p>Considering the possibility of methodological issues I tabulated study case and control definitions and exposure measures and assessed the risk of bias using RoB-SPEO<span class="citation" data-cites="Pega2020">[29]</span>, a tool for assessing risk of bias in studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to occupational risk factors. Seven<span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[30]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996">[46]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[34]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-Sancho2011">[40]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[42]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[44]</span> of the twelve case-control studies considered in the meta-analysis used population controls. One study<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[35]</span> used a pension fund record to select cases and controls, one study used an orthopaedic practice list<span class="citation" data-cites="Mullen1998">[33]</span>, and three studies used respiratory inpatients or a mix of respiratory inpatients and outpatients<span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[36]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Awadalla2012">[41]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[44]</span> Two studies did not match on age or sex<span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[42]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[36]</span> and one study matched on age only.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span></p>

<p>Application of the Rob-SPEO tool<span class="citation" data-cites="Pega2020">[29]</span> revealed that in general studies of occupational exposure in IPF to date are at high risk of selection bias due to low participation rates, recruitment from sources likely to be associated with exposures under study e.g respiratory inpatients, and lack of matching. The majority of studies also had a high risk of bias from exposure misclassification and/or incomplete exposure data through reliance on questionnaires that used yes/no questions for a limited number of specific exposures, bias due to lack of blinding, and possible bias due to differential reporting of exposures given that none of the studies appear to be pre-registered.

<h2 id="discussion"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>My results support the case for a proportion of IPF cases being attributable to occupational exposures. Pooled ORs were significantly elevated for VGDF, metal dust, wood dust, agricultural dust, and silica dust; the pooled PAF estimates by category ranged from 4-23%. This is an important finding for an otherwise idiopathic disease which carries significant morbidity and mortality; identifying causal occupational agents could permit remediation and prevention.</p>
<p>Associations between IPF and wood, metal, and agricultural dust were previously reported in a meta-analysis of six case-control studies by Taskar and Coultas. <span class="citation" data-cites="Taskar2006">[24]</span> While my findings are similar I found a smaller effect size for agricultural exposure and a large effect size for non-specific vapours, gases, dust, and fumes (VGDF), see Table 2.2.</p>
<p>Funnel plot asymmetry using Egger’s test, which may be due to publication bias, was present for VGDF (p = 0.04) and metal dust (p = 0.03) but not for wood dust (p = 0.09), silica dust (p = 0.2), and agricultural dust (p = 0.6). However, caution must be excercised in the interpretation of this since tests of funnel plot asymetry are underpowered to distinguish chance from real asymetry when fewer than 10 studies are being considered.<span class="citation" data-cites="Deeks2019">[47]</span></p>
<p>There are several limitations to the meta-analysis that arise from the studies included. Collectively application of the Rob-SPEO tool<span class="citation" data-cites="Pega2020">[29]</span> showed that these studies were at high risk for bias arising from selection, lack of blinding, exposure misclassification, incomplete exposure data, and selective reporting of exposures. Case definitions and sources for cases varied between studies. For example Scott (1990)<span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[30]</span> used a case definition which included a chest radiograph showing bilateral interstitial shadowing whereas most other studies relied on high resolution CT. Four studies used mortality data <span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[31]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Pinheiro2008">[38]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[35]</span> to identify cases and one study<span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span> used a national register of patients receiving oxygen therapy. Differences in healthcare coverage and coding practices can result in selection bias in studies making use of mortality data.<span class="citation" data-cites="Caminati2015">[48]</span> Nearly all of the studies relied on self-reported exposures rather than life time occupational histories to assess exposure; an approach that is prone to recall bias, does not permit examination of dose-response relationships, and is vulnerable to confounding as a result of co-exposure. For example, several studies have described strong associations between metal work and IPF and specify sheet metal workers<span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[31]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[30]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[35]</span>, a group who are frequently exposed to dust containing asbestos fibres<span class="citation" data-cites="Welch1994">[49]</span> and who in a recent UK study, had the highest risk of mesothelioma.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[50]</span> Seven of the IPF case-control studies considered in the meta-analysis did report on occupational asbestos exposure but found no significant association.<span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[30]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996">[46]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Mullen1998">[33]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[34]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[36]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[37]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[44]</span> This may be due to the studies considered being underpowered, not having used sufficiently sensitive asbestos exposure measures, and the methodological shortcomings of study design outlined above.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The observed excess risk could represent disease misclassification of pneumoconiosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but this is unlikely to fully explain the observed effects. My analysis supports an aetiologic role for occupational exposures in IPF, potentially explaining up to 23% of the burden of disease and highlighting a role for workplace exposure reduction in disease prevention.</p>
<p>Confidence in the meta-analyis results is tempered by the observation that collectively case-control studies investigating occupational exposures were at high risk for bias arising from selection, lack of blinding, exposure misclassification, incomplete exposure data, and selective reporting of exposures.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The incidence of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) has been increasing at an average rate of 5% per annum for the period 1979 to 2016.<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2019">[2]</span> By definition, the diagnosis of IPF is not made in the presence of an identifiable cause. However, the distribution of the disease in the population (more common in men, manual workers, and those living in more industrial areas of the country) suggests a causal contribution from an occupational or environmental source.</p>
<p>I hypothesised that a proportion of IPF cases are due to occult environmental or occupational exposures to asbestos dust. This would be expected to result in a spatio-temporal association between IPF, mesothelioma, and asbestosis mortality patterns coinciding with asbestos exposure. It would also be expected to produce a birth cohort effect.</p>
<p>I examined trends in IPF, mesothelioma, and asbestosis mortality data for evidence of cohort effect and association.</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>I obtained regional age and sex stratified mortality data for IPF, mesothelioma, and asbestosis for England and Wales from the Office of National Statistics for the period 1974–2012. All statistical analyses were carried out using Python<span class="citation" data-cites="van1995python">[51]</span>, SciPy<span class="citation" data-cites="2020SciPy-NMeth">[52]</span>, Statsmodels<span class="citation" data-cites="seabold2010statsmodels">[53]</span>, and Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Data were age-standardised and visualised. For regional analysis Poisson regression of rates was used adjusting for age and sex.</p>
<h2 id="results-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>IPF, mesothelioma, and asbestosis mortality rates increased thorough the study period. IPF increased at a rate of approximately 5% per annum. The ratio of female to male deaths for IPF is approximately 1:1.6 and the higest age and sex adjusted mortality rate ratios (RR) were in the North West (RR = 1.3, 95%CI 1.26-1.35, p0.001), Wales (RR = 1.28, 95%CI 1.23-1.33, p0.001), and the North East of England (RR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.19-1.29, p0.001). IPF mortality does appear to correlate with mesothelioma mortality (Figure ). There is evidence of a cohort effect with age-specific IPF death rates increasing in successive cohorts, most clearly seen from age 60 (Figure ). While overall rates were higher for men but there were not marked sex differences in cohort mortality trends. There was not a clear relationship in regional mortality for IPF, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (Table 1).</p>

<h2 id="discussion-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>I found evidence of a cohort effect whereby age specific-specific IPF death rates have increased in successive cohorts. These findings are similar to a recent study by Navaratnam et al using the same data source<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2019">[2]</span> and mesothelioma birth cohort age adjusted mortality trends.<span class="citation" data-cites="Darnton2012">[54]</span></p>
<p>Mortality data for IPF have advantage of capturing a sufficiently large number of deaths to permit analysis of trends over time with a reasonable degree of confidence. The accuracy of reports over time may have varied, this is a potential consequence of coding changes since prior to 2000, and the use of ICD-10, there was not a unique code for IPF and thus some ambiguity as to how it should be coded. However, a death certification validation study using an IPF cohort of 211 incident cases diagnosed in England and Wales between 2010 to 2012 found that of the 124 deaths occurring in the study period 83(67%) had IPF coded as the underlying cause of death and 102(82%) had it coded anywhere on the death certificate.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hutchinson2014">[6]</span> This is also true of asbestosis mortality, where by 2017 it was the underlying cause of death in less than half of cases it was recorded as a diagnosis on a death certificate.(see Figure 3.3) Therefore estimates of disease incidence based on mortality are likely to be conservative.</p>

Clearly this correlation does not prove causation and alternative explanations for the rise in IPF cases include increased recognition of cases<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2019">[2]</span> and overdiagnosis by radiologists on through misapplying CT criteria.<span class="citation" data-cites="Wells2013">[55]</span></p>

</figure>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is an unexplained sustained increase in the incidence of IPF and a very suggestive, if ecological, association with mesothelioma and lagged historic asbestos imports. There does appear to be a birth cohort effect whereby age specific rates are higher in later cohorts that would, for the data considered, be consistent with historic occupational asbestos exposure and a long latency between exposure and disease.</p>

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

<h2 id="introduction-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic.</p>
<p>Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung, they can be sampled by lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or at autopsy.</p>
<p>Historic workplace measurements are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, and where measurements are available they are dependent on working practices and measurement technique at the time of assessment; they do not necessarily generalize well.</p>
<p>Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistence of asbestos fibres is variable, the physical characteristics of inhaled fibres may be modified in-situ<span class="citation" data-cites="Mossman2011">[56]</span>, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeVuyst1998">[57]</span></p>
<p>Expert assessment and exposure modelling approaches integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individual’s recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999">[58]</span></p>
<p>Job-exposure matrices (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title. Industry specific asbestos JEMs have been developed, for example for workers in the gas and electricity industry<span class="citation" data-cites="Imbernon1995">[59]</span> as well as population asbestos JEMs, for example for all Dutch workers.<span class="citation" data-cites="Burdorf1999">[60]</span></p>
<p>Finally, self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to; these are usually elicited by questionnaire or at interview.</p>
<p>The asbestos exposure assessment literature presents difficulties for review because it is large and recognised to be at risk of bias as a result of its economic importance to powerful industrial and medicolegal actors<span class="citation" data-cites="Nemery2017">[61]</span>.</p>
<p>Here I critically review different means of historic asbestos exposure assessment and consider their clinical and research utility with a view to informing exposure measurement in the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).</p>
<h2 id="method-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>I searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for combinations and synonyms of “asbestos”, “exposure assessment”, together with terms for modes of assessment including “lung biopsy”, “bronchoalveolar lavage”, “exposure reconstruction”, and “job-exposure matrix”. When a relevant papers was identified, papers referenced, and papers citing, the paper were reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="lung-biopsy-and-bronchoalveolar-lavage"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage</h3>
<p>The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust<span class="citation" data-cites="Cooke1924">[62]</span> included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundant asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis.</p>
<p>The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestos exposure because fibres, particularly chrysotile fibres, may be cleared from the lung and counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeVuyst1998">[57]</span> Despite this, recent 2014 Helsinki guidelines<span class="citation" data-cites="Wolff2015">[63]</span> and UK Royal College of Pathologists guidelines<span class="citation" data-cites="Williamson2017">[64]</span> appear to suggest that a clear history of substantial occupational asbestos exposure is insufficient for diagnosis and that the absence of asbestos bodies or fibre counts above a certain threshold may be used to rule out the diagnosis. The shortcomings of such an approach highlighted above are also described by responses to the Helsinki guideline.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hammar2015">[65]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2016">[66]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2017">[67]</span></p>
<p>Lung biopsy carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function and it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.<span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2016">[66]</span> Therefore, the clinical utility of lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage is limited to ruling in asbestosis when a suggestive exposure history and radiology are lacking.</p>
<p>In a research context lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage have provided valuable population level insights. Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls. Fibre counts were found to be higher in groups with greater occupational risk, as defined by occupational proportional mortality rates (PMR) for pleural mesothelioma, providing additional support for the pre-eminence of an occupational history.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[50]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[68]</span> In a follow up study asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to demonstrated that population amphibole burden is falling and is proportional to mesothelioma mortality.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2018">[69]</span></p>
<p>A similar correlation between fibre counts and history of occupational exposure, an overall downward trend in fibre counts, and a significant false negative rate has been observed in a recent Belgian study of patients undergoing bronchoscopy with bronchoalvelolar lavage sampling for asbestos fibre quantification.<span class="citation" data-cites="Nuyts2017">[70]</span></p>
<h3 id="historic-workplace-measurements"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Historic workplace measurements</h3>
<p>Occupational hygienists have recorded a large numbers of workplace measurements of asbestos in different settings, at different times, using a variety of different means. These measurements reside in national databases such as the HSE National Exposure Database<span class="citation" data-cites="Burns1989">[71]</span>, and EV@LUTIL<span class="citation" data-cites="Orlowski2015">[72]</span>, in the published literature, and in unpublished company records.</p>
<p>The use of different means of making workplace assessments results in difficulties with respect to the accuracy and comparability of measurements. For example, instruments that count particles rather than asbestos fibres have been used and there is no established conversion factor.<span class="citation" data-cites="Peto1985">[73]</span> Phase contrast microscopy has also been used which is less sensitive that scanning electron microscopy, which is in turn less sensitive than transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.<span class="citation" data-cites="ATSDR2001">[74]</span></p>
<p>Where era and task specific workplace exposure data matching a particular patient’s occupational history is available and readily obtainable it is a valuable means of assessing exposure history. Unfortunately in practice measurements are usually limited to the subset of jobs thought to be potentially harmful “high” exposure jobs at the time of measurement. As awareness of the sources and harm of asbestos exposure has developed overtime the available data, until the use of asbestos was banned in the UK, is also skewed to more recent times.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[75]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[76]</span></p>
<p>Measurements have found greater utility in a research setting where they can help to quantify risk and inform regulatory policy and compliance in specific workplace settings, for example, in car mechanics<span class="citation" data-cites="Blake2006">[77]</span> or skilled craftsmen.<span class="citation" data-cites="Williams2007">[78]</span></p>
<h3 id="exposure-reconstruction"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Exposure reconstruction</h3>
<p>Sahmel et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[76]</span> propose a seven-step framework (see Figure ) which they use to enumerate and critique exposure reconstruction approaches.</p>
<p>Reconstruction techniques may be quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative. Quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on data from similar (historic or current) exposure scenarios or simulation studies. Semi-quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on exposure data matrices (using a job-exposure matrix) and/or exposure determinants (using an exposure model). Qualitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on the expert judgement of an industrial hygienist and self reported exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[76]</span></p>

<h4 id="job-exposure-matrices"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.1</span> Job-exposure matrices</h4>
<p>Several job-exposure matrices that deal with asbestos have been reported. Pannett et al’s 1985 job-exposure matrix for use in population studies in England and Wales<span class="citation" data-cites="Pannett1985">[79]</span> found good agreement between job-title assigned categories of exposure (none, low, moderate, high) for asbestos and direct review of the original occupational history by an expert. However, accoridng to co-author David Coggon (personal communication) it was based on Registrar General’s classification of occupations from 1966 and would not be readily applicable in a contempory study.</p>
<p>Rake et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[50]</span> assigned categories risk of exposure (low, medium, high) using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, is rapidly fatal, and UK death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (standardised pleural mesothelioma mortality in a given occupation/standardised pleural mesothelioma mortality across all occupations) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation. This approach has been validated in the same cohort by transmission electron microscopy asbestos fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[68]</span></p>
<p>DOM-JEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2011">[80]</span> was developed for use in a population based multi-centre lung cancer case-control study conducted in seven European countries. It assigns job titles to one of three categories of asbestos exposure (no exposure, low exposure, high exposure) based on the consensus of three independent expert raters. DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment () but less heterogeneity across countries than a population based JEM and expert assessment. A study applying DOM-JEM to the Netherlands Cohort Study (NCS) showed poor agreement with expert assessment (K = 0.29).<span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2012">[81]</span></p>
<p>The Finish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)<span class="citation" data-cites="Kauppinen1998">[82]</span> covers exposure to 84 different agents, including asbestos, for 311 jobs across 9 periods spanning 1945-2015. Era-specific estimates of the mean level of asbestos exposure are available for 27 jobs based on expert assessment and measurement data; the exact details of the grounds for estimates are kept in a proprietary FINJEM database which is sadly not freely available. FINJEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure () but reasonable identification of mesothelioma risk when evaluated using the NCS.<span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2012">[81]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2014">[83]</span></p>
<p>AsbJEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Oyen2015">[84]</span> was developed in Australia by an expert panel of three industrial hygienists using all available exposure data. It is based on FINJEM and provides quantitative estimates of annual exposure for 224 occupations across three time periods spanning 1943 to 2004. It also showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure ().<span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2012">[81]</span></p>
<p>SYN-JEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2016">[85]</span> describes a JEM developed for four carcinogens. It provides quantified asbestos exposure estimates based on 27958 personal measurements (spanning 1971-2009) from several European countries and Canada, a mixed effects statistical model, and <em>a priori</em> categorical assessment of exposure (none, low, high). Cherrie et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[86]</span> point out that SYN-JEM provides little contrast in the modelled exposure level between categories as the geometric mean intensity for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml and that there are wide variations in country-level estimates that are difficult to explain.</p>
<p>JEMS are generally taken to be superior to direct questions about exposures because they have greater validity, and are less vulnerable to differential recall. Using a JEM recall of occupations is not influenced by disease status, coding of occupation is blind to case-control status, and translation of codes into exposure is standardized. Therefore exposure assessment is safeguarded from bias by the subject’s disease status.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ahrens1993">[87]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[88]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gramond2012">[89]</span></p>
<p>Orlowski et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Orlowski1993">[90]</span> compared two JEMs with a structured job specific questionnaire (SQ) in a lung cancer case-control study. They found that agreement between the JEMs and the SQ was poor () and suggested that the sources of error for JEMs were loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and the insufficiency of published data on occupational asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>JEMs are not routinely used in clinical practice because they are not usually available or accessible for specific patients. In a research setting they are frequently helpful though in addition to the strengths and weaknesses outlined above the desirability of reusing an existing JEM vs developing a study specific JEM must be considered.</p>
<h4 id="exposure-modelling-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Exposure modelling approaches</h4>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches modify existing measurement data on the basis of knowledge of the determinants of exposure. They may be viewed as the formalization of professional decision criteria used by hygienists in their assessment of workplace exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[75]</span></p>
<p>A common conceptual framework for this is the source-receptor model<span class="citation" data-cites="Tielemans2008">[91]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[75]</span> whereby inhalation exposure is considered in terms of an exposure source, a pathway from source to receptor, and the receptor. The model is then used to propose modifying factors such as activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection.<span class="citation" data-cites="Tielemans2008">[91]</span>.</p>
<p>In the hands of some hygienists assessment of historic asbestos exposure based on interview can correlate well with amphibole fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rodelsperger2001">[92]</span> By extension, exposure modelling approaches, using industrial hygienist methods, might be expected to be useful. Exposure modelling approaches make strong intuitive sense; it is known that there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures<span class="citation" data-cites="Symanski2006">[93]</span> and, for example, room size and ventilation have been empirically shown to affect the concentration of airborne chemical exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999a">[94]</span> Further, mathematical exposure models that take account of known exposure modifying factors to estimate past exposures have shown a good correlation with measured values.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999">[58]</span></p>
<p>A quantified validated historic asbestos exposure model<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[86]</span> has recently been developed and proposed as a means of for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The approach has the advantage, compared with job-exposure matrices, of providing a more granular quantified exposure assessment, sensitive to the exposure circumstances of the individual. However, the approach is limited by the fact that the individual must recall their exposure circumstances which due to the latency of asbestos related disease may have occurred over 30 years ago. The approach is also limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for validation, though though is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data.</p>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches to assessing asbestos exposure have research and clinical utility notwithstanding the limitations outlined above together with the requirement that assessors be appropriately trained.</p>
<h4 id="self-reported-exposure"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.3</span> Self-reported exposure</h4>
<p>Self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to. Typically this is elicited by asking about a specific exposure via questionnaire or interview. Differential recall of self-reported exposures according to disease status is a concern but few studies have found evidence of this and it appears to be less of an issue when prompted responses, rather than volunteered, responses about occupational exposures are used.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2000">[95]</span></p>
<p>Most studies comparing self-reported exposures to industrial hygiene measurements have found significant associations but with wide variation in the proportions of variance explained by the self reports. This is not surprising given that it is known there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[88]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Symanski2006">[93]</span></p>
<p>Studies comparing self-reported exposures to expert assessment find highly variable levels of agreement () with a median  . In two studies comparing self-reported exposures with JEMs, self-reported exposures were more sensitive and of similar or worse specificity.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[88]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have been shown to be more accurate for easily sensed exposures such as solvents with a strong smell, dusts with larger particle sizes, and vibrations that can be felt. Providing a reference point, for example using well known machines from a workplace to gauge noise category also improves accuracy.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[88]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have clinical utility in that they can suggest or support consideration of an occupational cause for disease. Ideally such self-reports are combined with the clinicians knowledge of the likely occupational exposures given the occupational history and other available data to strengthen or weaken the case as appropriate. Similarly, they have utility in a research setting where they may augment other means of assessment.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The accuracy of historic asbestos exposure assessment, by any means, is limited by the paucity of occupational asbestos measurement data, measurement technique limitations, within and between worker exposure variability, and participant recall. There does not exist a universally agreed “gold standard” against which to evaluate methods. Accurate quantified assessment of historic exposure, where evidence is scarce, may be an impossible task.<span class="citation" data-cites="Burstyn2011">[96]</span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, clinically, historic asbestos exposure assessments must be made for attribution. Specifically, to inform whether the required threshold of asbestos exposure (as assessed by various means) has been crossed so it is possible to say that, for example, scarring of the lung with an usual interstitial pneumonia pattern in an individual patient is caused by asbestos exposure. This carries medicolegal in addition to scientific importance and has not been well established by any assessment method.</p>
<p>In the context of mesothelioma case-control studies fibre-counts do at least provide an objective means of assessing historic asbestos exposure against which other means can be compared. It is encouraging that industrial hygienist assessment and assessment using job title and PMR correlates strongly with fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gramond2012">[89]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[68]</span> Further and more generally, it is encouraging that estimates from explicit asbestos exposure modelling systems such as Cherrie et al’s<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[86]</span>, show good correlation with measurement data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Quantitative estimates of historic occupational asbestos exposures will generally have high uncertainty. However, less precise measures, such as relative difference in exposure among epidemiological groups may be quite certain even though the numerical estimates are only approximate. This is invaluable in studies examining aetiological hypothesis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[75]</span></p>

<h3 id="mucus-mucins-muc5b-structure-function-and-evolutionary-importance"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Mucus, Mucins, MUC5b: structure, function and evolutionary importance</h3>
<p>Mucus is an essential part of the innate immune system, considered to be universal within most phyla of both aquatic and terrestrial metazoans. It plays a pivotal role in the prevention of disease by serving as an antimicrobial barrier, it also has physiological functions including allowing the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrient and metabolites, lubricating surfaces and reducing damage due to sheer, reducing dehydration of the epithelia and providing the polymeric matrix which enables ciliary-mucus particle transport.</p>
<p>Mucus barriers are essential for the separation and protection of an organism from its external environment, and likely a prerequisite for the exclusion of bacteria from bodily tissues and evolution of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The importance of mucus barriers is further underlined when one considers the energy investment continuous mucus production and release requires; for example, corals use mucus to trap particles and transport them towards their mouths and the reef-building coral Acropora acuminata is thought to dedicate up to 40% of its daily net carbon fixation (energy from photosynthesis) to this task alone.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[97]</span> Mucins are a key component of mucus, they are highly evolutionary conserved large glycoproteins that date back around 600 million years to Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, which is an early marine invertebrate. The earliest human mucin analogue is found in Xenopus tropicalis, the African clawed frog, which evolved about 300 million years ago and mucins are the likely explanation for the observation that frogs show such great resistance to infection during dissection. It has been shown that knockdown of mucin in the skin mucus barrier of Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles leads to susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dubaissi2018">[98]</span></p>
<p>The mucin family is composed of proteins that contain tandom repeat structures with a high proportion of prolines, threonines, and serines; the PTS domain. It is further defined by extensive glycosylation of the PTS domain through N-Acetylgalactosamine O-linkages at the threonine and serine residues.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kufe2009">[99]</span> The resultant oligisaccharide chains and polymeric structure create the viscoeleastic properties of mucus which confer its barrier properties and play an important role in storage and secretion. <span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[97]</span> Mucins are 50-90% carbohydrate and they are anionic because most of their terminal sugars contain carboxyl or sulphate groups. Mucin glycan helps to sequester pathogen by acting as a ‘decoy’ and providing sites for microbial adhesins to bind; for example, human salivary MUC5b interacts with streptococcal species, and patterns of glycosylation change during inflammation.<span class="citation" data-cites="Linden2008">[100]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[101]</span> Mucin barriers can be subverted by pathogens, strategies include production of enzymes to degrade mucin core proteins and mucin carbohydrates, and evolution of effective motility through mucus gels - many mucosal bacterial pathogens are flagellated for this reason. There is evidence that degradative enzymes are required for pathogenesis in species such as Vibrio cholorae and that flagella are required for infectivity in species such as Helicobacter pylori.<span class="citation" data-cites="Linden2008">[100]</span> Intracellular gel-forming mucins are stored in a compact and condensed form in granules within mucus-secreting cells. They are stored in solution with a high concentration of calcium ions and protons which is thought to be necessary to mask the anionic charge and prevent electrostatic repulsion, upon secretion mucins expand 1000-3000 fold taking up water to form a gel as calcium is exchanged for sodium and the pH rises.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[97]</span> One consequence of mucins being stored in such a compact form is that when they’re released they can obstruct the airway which in mouse models appears necessary for the clearance of helminth infection<span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[101]</span> and may provide a clue to their evolution.</p>
<p>Normal human airway mucus is a hydrogel composed of approximately 98% water, 0.9% salt, 0.8% globular proteins, and 0.3% high-molecular-weight mucin polymers.<span class="citation" data-cites="Boucher2019">[102]</span> Mucin hypersecretion may increase the concentration of solids up to 15% resulting in viscous elastic mucus that is not easily cleared.<span class="citation" data-cites="Fahy2010">[103]</span> 17 genes encode mucins in the human genome of which the gene products of seven are secreted and the remainder are membrane bound. Five of the secreted mucins have terminal cysteine rich domains that can form disulfide bonds resulting in polymers that impart the properties of a gel. MUC5AC and MUC5B, two secreted gel-forming mucins, are strongly expressed in the human respiratory tract. MUC5AC is predominantly expressed in the conducting airways and MUC5B is predominantly expressed in the respiratory airways (MUC5b is also expressed in salivary glands, cervix, gallbladder, seminal fluid, and middle ear epithelium). Secreted mucins are large glycoproteins (up to 3x10^6 D per monomer), ranking among the largest molecules encoded in mammalian genomes, and their expression induces and requires an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dickey2017">[104]</span> Mucin production and secretion are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Production is highly regulated at transcriptional level. The ErbB family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its first discovered member. ErbB-receptor signaling appears important for MUC5AC production since inhibition blocks MUC5AC up-regulation by diverse stimuli. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, natural killer T cell, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. IL-13 is a central regulator in IgE synthesis, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, fibrosis and chitinase up-regulation. It is a mediator of allergic inflammation and different diseases including asthma. IL-13 appears important because it increases MUC5AC expression (IL-1 beta appears to be an important stimulus for MUC5b expression<span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[101]</span>). Basal levels of production and secretion of MUC5AC and MUC5B change as part of an allergic response. The production of MUC5AC can increase 40-200 times as high as normal levels in humans with similar findings in mice, MUC5B increases more modestly, 3 to 10 times in mice. The most important stimulus for secretion appears to be ATP which acts on apical membrane purinergenic (P2Y<sub>2</sub>) receptors. Once secreted mucus gel is propelled in a proximal direction towards the mouth, by ciliary beating as part of the mucociliary escalator, where it is expectorated or swallowed. <span class="citation" data-cites="Fahy2010">[103]</span></p>
<h3 id="muc5b-rs3570950-and-respiratory-disease"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> MUC5b rs3570950 and respiratory disease</h3>
<p>Expression and localisation of MUC5AC and MUC5B is different in patients with lung disease compared with healthy controls. MUC5AC expression is increased in asthma for example, while MUC5B expression is increased in COPD<span class="citation" data-cites="Kesimer2017">[105]</span> and IPF. In COPD MUC5b expression occurs in more proximal airways, whereas in IPF it is localised to the bronchiole.<span class="citation" data-cites="Helling2017">[106]</span> MUC5b appears to be particularly important in IPF.</p>
<p>The gain of function promoter variant rs5270590, 3.5 kb upstream of the mucin 5b (MUC5B) transcriptional start site, is the strongest identified risk factor (genetic or otherwise) for the development of either sporadic or familial IPF. The largest study to date (1616 non- white patients with fibrotic interstitial pneumonias and 4683 controls) estimated that the odds of developing pulmonary fibrosis for those with one copy of the risk allele were 4.5 times (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) the odds of those with no copies and that the odds for those with two copies are 20.2 times those with no copies (95% CI: 15.2–27.0).<span class="citation" data-cites="Fingerlin2013">[107]</span> The strength of association is substantially higher than for most other common risk variants for complex disease with the exception of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region for some autoimmune diseases such as type-1 diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus which have OR greater than 10. The association between the minor allele of rs35705950 and IPF has been replicated in 3 genome wide association studies (GWAS) and a total of 10 independent cohorts including a Mexican cohort and two Asian cohorts and is thought to account for about a third of IPF cases.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span> However, penetrance is low with up to 20% of non-Hispanic whites having at least one copy of the variant yet IPF occurring only rarely (prevalence &lt; 1%) . The rs35705950 variant is a G-to-T transversion that occurs in an area of the MUC5B 5’ flanking region, a region which has characteristics of being an enhancer subject to epigenetic control via DNA methylation and histone modification.<span class="citation" data-cites="Helling2017">[106]</span> An enhancer is a sequence of DNA that functions to enhance transcription. A promoter is a sequence of DNA that initiates the process of transcription. A promoter has to be close to the gene that is being transcribed while an enhancer does not need to be close to the gene of interest. Publicly available data through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) suggest MUC5b promoter site is a complex area of the genome with many transcriptional factors showing evidence of binding.<span class="citation" data-cites="Selman2006">[108]</span> In other words MUC5b expression is likely a function of genetic and non-genetic factors.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span> In addition to IPF, rs35705950 has been found to be positively associated with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis associated interstitial lung disease (AAV-ILD).<span class="citation" data-cites="Namba2019">[109]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Platenburg2020">[18]</span> It has also been found to not be associated with cutaneous systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), sarcoidosis, and myositis-ILD. <span class="citation" data-cites="Adegunsoye2019">[110]</span></p>
<h4 id="potential-role-in-ipf-pathogenesis"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.1</span> Potential role in IPF pathogenesis</h4>
<p>The rs5270590 variant is associated with a 34 fold increase in expression of MUC5b compared with wild type in healthy control populations and a 5 fold increase in patients with IPF (see figure 1).<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span> In IPF patients distal airway MUC5b is expressed preferentially, compared with MUC5Ac. MUC5b is also expressed in honeycomb cysts, a defining characteristic of the usual interstitial pneumonia CT pattern typically seen in IPF.<span class="citation" data-cites="Seibold2013">[16]</span></p>

<p>Proposed mechanisms for the role of the rs5270590 variant in the pathogenesis of IPF include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Excessive production of MUC5B by stem cells that attempt to regenerate injured bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium could disrupt normal development pathways and highjack normal reparative mechanisms of the distal lung resulting in fibroprolferation and honeycomb cyst formation.</li>
<li>Excessive MUC5B production leading to reduced mucociliary function, retention of particles, and enhanced lung injury.</li>
<li>Interaction between MUC5b and motile cilia since distinct cilium gene expression in IPF lung has been observed.</li>
<li>Excessive MUC5b production inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Muc5b has been studied in mice. A muc5b knockout mouse study found that muc5b is essential for mucociliary clearance, for controlling airway and middle ear infections, and maintaining immune homeostasis in the lungs. Knockout mice had airflow limitation and died from infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus.<span class="citation" data-cites="Roy2014">[111]</span> A transgenic muc5b mouse model of muc5b overexpression found that overexpression causes mucociliary dysfuction and enhances lung fibrosis on response to bleomycin.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hancock2018">[112]</span> Intriguingly, in recent bleomycin lung fibrosis model studies lung fibrosis was attenuated and mortality reduced in both germ-free mice and IL-17B deficient mice supporting the concept that fibrosis in response to epithelial injury is mediated by interaction of the immune system with microbiota.<span class="citation" data-cites="ODwyer2019">[113]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2019">[114]</span></p>
<h3 id="infection-and-immunity"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Infection and immunity</h3>
<p>The frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10% in European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950) but is less than 1% in African and East Asian populations. Clearly the rs35705950 variant is not subject to negative selection due to IPF risk since onset is well after the reproductive age begins<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[17]</span>; the variation in frequency observed is consistent with strong positive selection. The increased MUC5b expression in the airways associated with the rs35705950 variant may have conferred a survival advantage by providing protection against lung infection. <span class="citation" data-cites="Dickey2017">[104]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[101]</span> A relation between the rs35705950 variant, disease risk, and infection is also supported by the observation that in a prospective study of 65 IPF patients and 44 COPD and health controls, IPF patients had higher bacterial loads than COPD and healthy controls and within IPF patients those with homozygous (TT) for variant had significantly lower bacterial loads (P=0.01), measured by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction of bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Within IPF those with higher bacterial loads were also at increased risk of death.<span class="citation" data-cites="Molyneaux2014">[115]</span> These finding are consistent with observation that the rs35705950 variant is associated with improved survival in IPF<span class="citation" data-cites="Peljto2013">[116]</span> and fewer acute respiratory disease events in the COPDGene cohort with interstitial features.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ash2018">[117]</span> However, these studies are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis if not properly accounted for.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dudbridge2019">[118]</span> For example, it is known that the rs35705950 variant is associated with interstitial lung abnormalities<span class="citation" data-cites="Hunninghake2013">[119]</span>, since the diagnosis of IPF relies heavily on radiological appearances individuals with the variant might tend to be diagnosed earlier in the course of their disease giving the false impression, when comparing them to IPF patients without the disease variant that is associated with survival. Further support for the importance of infection in IPF provided by the observation that immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon gamma, ethanercept, prednisolone, azathioprine and N-acetylcysteine have failed to prolong survival in IPF<span class="citation" data-cites="WarheitNiemi2019">[120]</span> to prolong survival in IPF, from a small (N = 181) double blinded randomized controlled study which found reduced symptom burden and improved survival associated with cotrimoxazole<span class="citation" data-cites="Shulgina2013">[121]</span>, as well as evidence from genetic and animal studies. IPF GWAS have identified single nucleotide variants associated with disease susceptibility in the Toll interacting protein (TOLLIP) gene, for example rs111521887. TOLLIP is an inhibitory adaptor protein within Toll-like receptors (TLR) and part of the innate immune system recognising pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)<span class="citation" data-cites="Noth2013">[122]</span> and, intriguingly, in a mouse bleomycin lung fibrosis model the absence of a microbiome protected against mortality.<span class="citation" data-cites="ODwyer2019">[113]</span></p>
<h3 id="inorganic-occupational-stimuli"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> Inorganic occupational stimuli</h3>
<p>The frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10% in European populations(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950) but its penetrance is low; the median prevalence of IPF for men and women in Europe is approximately 3.75 per 100000 for the period 2001-2013<span class="citation" data-cites="Marshall2018">[123]</span>, which suggests other genetic or environmental factors must be at play. In addition to responding to PAMPs as outlined above the innate immune system also responds to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which can result from inhalation of inorganic respirable toxins such as silica or asbestos. Silica and asbestos are specifcally senesed by the NLRP3 inflammasome which, when activated, results in increased IL-1 beta secretion.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dostert2008">[19]</span> Secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta (which is also a key stimulus for MUC5b expression) is elevated in alveolar macrophages of patients with ILD, including IPF, sarcoidosis, silicosis, RA-ILD, and asbestosis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Byrne2016">[124]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Howrylak2017">[125]</span> It is also increased in a dose-dependent fashion is reponse to smoking.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kuschner1996">[126]</span> Inflammasomes are multiprotein intracellular complexes that detect pathogenic microorganisms (PAMPs) and sterile stressors (DAMPs).

<h2 id="conclusion-3"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The apparently complex interplay between exposure to organic and inorganic respiratory toxins, the mucus barrier, respiratory epithelium and resident cells such as alveolar macrophages in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely characterised but genetic, epigenetic, gene-expression, and epidemiological studies are beginning to fill in the gaps. Gene-environment interaction between the rs5270590 variant and occupational inorganic respiratory toxins such as asbestos may modulate IPF risk and help to explain the incomplete penetrance observed. Studies to date which have selected patients on the basis of a diagnosis of IPF and then stratified by MUC5b genotype are at risk of index-event bias. A large case-control study of IPF which captures details of occupational exposures, genotype, and potential confounders, whilst also measuring factors likely to affect disease pickup such as disease severity and radiographic changes is required.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Occult occupational asbestos exposure as a cause for otherwise ‘idiopathic’ pulmonary fibrosis has been an open question for at least 30 years. It arises because of the clinical and radiological similarities of asbestosis and IPF; a usual interstitial pneumonia is observed in both, and patients can present in the same way (chapter 1). Patients having significant asbestos exposure, that would warrant a diagnosis of asbestosis, may go undetected because they do not recall exposure or because where they do recall exposure it is difficult to assess if it has been sufficient to have caused disease (chapter 4). A recent meta-analysis of IPF case control studies reporting on occupational exposures found significant associations between metal, wood, and stone dust, and IPF (chapter 2). However, the extent of confounding by groups of workers likely to have significant asbestos co-exposure, for example metal sheet workers and carpenters, is unknown. The majority of these studies are limited by their reliance on self-reported binary exposure which risks recall bias and does not permit investigation of dose-response relationships which would be helpful for establishing causality. Studies to date have also not looked at the possibility of gene-environment interaction; genetic risk factors such as rs5270590 are now well established and interaction with inhaled exposures is suspected but has not yet been proven in humans (chapter 5). The question of asbestos exposure in IPF is a live one globally because countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China continue to consume large quantities of asbestos and, closer to home, asbestos related and IPF mortality rates continue to rise. While asbestos related mortality in the UK is driven primarily by pleural mesothelioma and is expected to peak in the next couple of years as a result of effective asbestos exposure control legislation, the sustained rise in IPF mortality rates is unexplained (chapter 3).</p>
<h2 id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Overview</h2>
<p>IPFJES is a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study conceived to definitively address the question of asbestos exposure having a causal role in IPF. Participants were recruited from a network of 21 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. ‘Cases’ were men who presented with a new MDT-confirmed diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria.<span class="citation" data-cites="Raghu2011">[132]</span> Controls were men who attended randomly selected outpatient clinics in the same time period. Over 460 cases and 460 controls, frequency-matched on age, were recruited to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants. Participants were interviewed by telephone using a bespoke study web application (ipfjes-interview, full source code available at www.ipfjes.org). Lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score were recorded. Each occupation was coded on the basis of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90) at the time of the interview. For participants who recalled carrying out tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded. SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fibre-ml.year estimate was calculated for participants recalling asbestos exposure. All participants provided an EDTA venous blood sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF susceptibility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950 using Q-PCR and a Taqman assay. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse ‘any’ vs ‘no’ asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. In a secondary analysis we used uncondiational logistic regression to investigate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occupational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions.</p>
<h2 id="method-3"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Method</h2>
<h3 id="funding-approvals-and-registration"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Funding, approvals, and registration</h3>
<p>We obtained funding from the Wellcome Trust (201291/Z/16/Z) and NHS ethical approval (IRAS project ID 203355, REC reference 17/EM/0021). We also obtained NIHR portfolio status (CPMS ID 203355) and registered the study on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03211507). Full study documentation is available online at www.ipfjes.org.</p>
<h3 id="selection"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Selection</h3>
<p>Initially 15 hospitals were invited to collaborate as recruiting centres for IPFJES. Centres were selected on the basis of us having a known contact there, the centre having an IPF MDT, geographic dispersion, and confirmation that the centre could recruit 40 cases and 40 controls over two years. Six additional centres were added to ensure the study wide recruitment target was achieved when it became apparent that only seven of the original 15 recruiting centres would meet their agreed target.</p>
<p>Cases were men of any age who were first diagnosed with IPF at any of 21 collaborating hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. The diagnosis of IPF by the referring centres was made at MDT on the basis of clinical history, high-resolution computed-tomography (HRCT), and where necessary lung biopsy in accordance with standard criteria.<span class="citation" data-cites="Raghu2011">[132]</span> Referring centres provided HRCT report findings for all cases and histopathology report findings for cases where a biopsy was performed.</p>
<p>At each collaborating hospital an outpatient clinic was randomly selected from a list of all outpatient clinics (not confined to respiratory) to serve as source clinic for the recruitment of controls. If the clinic selected was unsuitable, for example because it did not contain men of a similar age to cases or the clinic lead declined to participate then this was recorded and a further random selection made. Controls were men who attended the selected outpatient clinics between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. They were frequency-matched on age to five year age brackets, and recruited in a 1:1 ratio to cases to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants.</p>
<p>Men who were unable to give informed consent or who had worked outside of the UK for one year or more (not including work as a member of the armed forces or merchant navy) were excluded from being cases and controls. Cases and controls were approached by local research teams and provided with the IPFJES participant information sheet. They were given the opportunity to read it and ask questions and then invited to sign the consent form and provide their contact details and a blood sample if they wished to take part. Local researchers completed a case report form detailing participant demographic information, CT and biopsy results, and contact details which was sent together with the blood sample by secure post to the central research team.</p>
<h3 id="measures"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Measures</h3>
<p>A trained interviewer (RS or CR) who was blind to the case status of participants undertook the study interviews by telephone; interviews were recorded for quality control purposes. The interviewer used a bespoke web application, called ipfjes-interview, to administer a structured interview collecting information on lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history of scarring lung disease, mMRC dyspnoea score, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. For each job information was collected on the job title, job tasks, employer, start and stop year of employment, and whether employment was full-time (&gt;=35 hour per week) or part time. Smoking history was recorded as start and stop year of smoking, number of cigarettes (or equivalent using https://www.smokingpackyears.com/) per day, and what was smoked - cigarettes/roll-ups/pipe/other. Participants were asked about prior exposure to nine drugs suspected of causing usual interstitial pneumonia (amiodarone, azathioprine, bleomycin, flecainide, gefitinib, ifosamide, melphalan, and nitrofurantoin).<span class="citation" data-cites="Bonniaud2014">[133]</span> Using the job title and ipfjes-interview each occupation was coded in real time to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90).</p>
<p>SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma.<span class="citation" data-cites="Peto2009">[134]</span> Five main categories were used (See also Figure 6.1):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>High-risk non-construction</li>
<li>High-risk construction</li>
<li>Medium risk industrial</li>
<li>Low risk industrial</li>
<li>Office</li>
</ol>
<p>For analysis of categories of exposure participants were assigned to the highest risk category they ever had a job in.</p>

</figure>
<p>For participants who recalled carrying out work tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded. A fibre-ml/year estimate was calculated using a model with parameters for the type of asbestos used (substance emission potential, E), what was done with it (activity emission potential, H), how well ventilated the room the activity was carried out in was (general ventilation parameters, D), and whether there were any local exposure controls, for example wetting (local controls, LC). The calculation to estimate asbestos exposure (AE) for a given asbestos related task was: AE = E * H * LC. AE for each task was then weighted according to the total amount of time spent performing the task to arrive at a task fibre-ml/year exposure estimate. Task fibre-ml/year exposure estimates were then summed at an individual participant level to provide an overall fibre-ml/year estimate. A random sample of high (top 25% of values), medium (25-75% centile), and low (bottom 25% of values) estimates was checked by a hygiene assessment expert who was blind to participant case status (JC).<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999">[58]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[86]</span></p>
<p>SOC90 coded jobs were also used to assign National Statistics Socio-economic analytic classes (NS-SEC). The Office of National Statistics provides a lookup to assign each SOC90 code to one of eight classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations. 1.1 Large employers and higher managerial and administrative occupations. 1.2 Higher professional occupations.</li>
<li>Lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations</li>
<li>Intermediate occupations</li>
<li>Small employers and own account workers</li>
<li>Lower supervisory and technical occupations</li>
<li>Semi-routine occupations</li>
<li>Routine occupations</li>
<li>Never worked and long-term unemployed</li>
</ol>
<p>We then assigned each individual to a single code by calculating the median code for all of the jobs they had held.</p>
<p>Participants were classified as occupationally exposed to stone, wood, and metal dust or not (binary measure) on the basis of the recorded participant provided description of tasks carried out within a job including the words ‘stone’ (or ‘silica’), ‘wood’, or ‘metal’, respectively.</p>
<p>All participants provided an EDTA sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF susceptibility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950. DNA was extracted using a nucleon dna extraction kit. Genotypes of the MUC5B SNP rs35705950 were determined using TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions were performed in 96-well plates, and fluorescence was read using an Applied Biosystems Viia7 Sequence Detection System. See appendix (or ipfjes.org) for full study protocol and standard operating procedures.</p>
<h3 id="statistical-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4</span> Statistical analysis</h3>
<p>Statistical analyses were carried out using Python<span class="citation" data-cites="van1995python">[51]</span>, SciPy<span class="citation" data-cites="2020SciPy-NMeth">[52]</span>, Statsmodels<span class="citation" data-cites="seabold2010statsmodels">[53]</span>, and Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).</p>
<p>Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse ‘any’ vs ‘no’ asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age, smoking status and recruiting centre as part of a prespecified analysis (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03211507).</p>
<p>In a planned secondary analysis we investigated for possibile interaction between asbestos exposure and rs35705950 genotype.</p>
<p>In unplanned secondary analysis we used logistic regression to investigate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occupational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions. Sensitivity analysis of distance to centre was also performed because we expected cases to live further away from the hospital that controls on average (as IPF care is centralised to a select number of specialist centres) and we hypothesised that distance from the hospital might be associated with likelihood of exposure to asbestos. We used Pearson’s correlation coefficient to investigate associations between individual variables, such as distance from hospital and fibre-ml.year asbestos exposure estimates. We used ordinal logistic regression to investigate the relationship between mMRC dyspnoea score and measures of asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>In the course of this work I learned that the minor allele of rs35705950 was associated with asbestosis<span class="citation" data-cites="Platenburg2020">[18]</span>, that smoking and asbestos exposure interact significantly in asbestosis<span class="citation" data-cites="Mossman1998">[130]</span>, and that this interaction is likely to be mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation<span class="citation" data-cites="Dostert2008">[19]</span>; a process which results in increased MUC5b expression. This led me to hypothesise that there may be an interaction between rs35705950, asbestos, and smoking. To test this hypothesis I stratified by genotype and investigated interaction between smoking and occupational asbestos exposure using unconditional logistic regression.</p>

<h2 id="results-3"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Results</h2>
<p>516 cases and 511 controls were recruited to IPFJES in the study period Feb 2017 to October 2019. 22 of 516 cases(4%), and 45 of 511 controls(9%) were withdrawn because they no longer wished to take part in the study, they did not respond after we called them on three occasions, or we were notified that they had died before the interview took place. The remaining 960 participants (494 cases, 466 controls) comprise the study sample.</p>
<p>The median year of birth and age was 1943 and 76 for cases and 1945 and 74 for controls. Most cases and controls reported their ethnicity as white (97% and 96% respectively). Social economic class and exposure to smoking were similar for cases and controls (see Table one).</p>

One hundred and twenty five (25%) of cases and 108 (23%) controls recalled occupational asbestos exposure in sufficient detail to permit estimation of cumulative fibre-ml.year exposure. Forty one (33%) cases and 35 (32%) of controls, which equated to approximately 8% of the total number of cases and 8% of the total number of controls, had cumulative estimates exceeding 25 asbestos fibre-ml.years (see Table six).</p>

Ninety participant samples remain to be genotyped (they have not yet been because of staffing issues), 52 participants did not provide a sample. Being heterozygous for the disease associated variant (GT) had an odds ratio of 5 (95%CI 3.7-6.8; p &lt; 0.001) for disease. Being homozygous for the disease associated variant (GG) had an odds ratio of 13.3 (95%CI 5.1-35, p &lt; 0.001) for disease.

<p>Cases and controls lived an average of 28km and 16km respectively from their recruiting hospital, measured by calculating the distance between the postcode centroid of the participants general practice and the postcode centroid of the hospital. Living further away from the hospital correlated with being a case, r=0.22, 95%CI = 0.16-0.29, p &lt; 0.001 and weakly correlated with reduced asbestos exposure, r=-0.06, 95%CI = -0.13-0, p=0.05.

<p>To investigate cumulative ‘dose’ of exposure based on job title a score was assigned based on asbestos exposure risk category of each job as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-risk non-construction : 2</li>
<li>high-risk construction : 2</li>
<li>medium risk industrial : 1</li>
<li>low risk industrial : 0</li>

<p>Scores were then multiplied for each job by the duration in years of the job and then summed at participant level. See Table fifteen and Figure 6.8.</p>

<p>Three hundred and ten (63%) IPF cases initially presented to their doctor with cough and 306 (62%) with breathlessness (91 patients presented with cough and breathlessness). Fifteen (3%) cases and 42 (9%) controls reported ever taking a medication suspected of causing usual interstitial pneumonia (amiodarone, azathioprine, bleomycin, flecainide, gefitinib, ifosamide, melphalan, and nitrofurantoin).<span class="citation" data-cites="Bonniaud2014">[133]</span></p>
<p>Four hundred and forteen (83%) cases and 441 (95%) controls reported one or more comorbidities. The most commonly reported comorbidities (occurring in at least 10 cases or controls) occurred at a similar frequency in cases and controls and included hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, osteoarthritis, and prostate cancer. Rheumatoid arthritis was reported in 18 cases, approximately 2% of cases reporting a comorbidity, and in 9 controls, approximately 1% of controls reporting a comorbidity. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) was reported in 14 cases, approximately 1.5% of cases reporting a comorbidity, and in 2 controls, approximately 0.5% of controls reporting a comorbidity.</p>
<p>Dyspnoea, as measured by the mMRC dyspnoea scale was associated with case-status, smoking status, genotype, and asbestos exposure. Pearson’s correlation coefficient for IPF was 0.49 (95%CI 0.44-0.53, p&lt;0.001), ever smoking was 0.16 (95%CI 0.09-0.23, p&lt;0.001), pack-year smoked was 0.2 (95%CI 0.13-0.26, p&lt;0.001), genotype 0.2 (95%CI 0.13-0.27, p&lt;0.001), ever held a medium or high risk asbestos exposure job title 0.09 (95%CI 0.02-0.16, p=0.02), and 0.15 (95%CI 0.08-0.21, p&lt;0.001) for having a fibre-ml.year estimate &gt; 25.

<p>Ever being exposed to an occupation at high or medium risk for asbestos exposure was common for both cases (67%) and controls (63%) and the difference in the proportion exposed between cases and controls was not significant (Table four). A similar pattern was observed for categories of exposure (Table five). 8% of cases and controls had estimated cumulative asbestos fibre-ml.year exposures in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years, the Helsinki criteria exposure threshold at which cases of asbestosis may occur.<span class="citation" data-cites="Wolff2015">[63]</span> The majority of these participants had high or medium risk occupations as defined by job title with carpenter being the single most common job title accounting for 5% of all estimates in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years.</p>
<p>In common with numerous previous studies we found MUC5b rs3570950 to be strongly associated with disease in a risk allele dose-dependant fashion OR 5 (95% CI 3.7-6.8, p  0.001) for GT, OR 13.3 (95% CI 5.1-35, p  0.001) for TT (see Table seven). We found no evidence of interaction between asbestos exposure and MUC5b rs3570950. However, we did find a significant association for having ever smoked, OR 1.4 (95%CI 1-1.8, p = 0.03) and for having ever smoked and having ever had a high or medium asbestos exposure risk based on job title, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p = 0.04). Sensitivity analyses including limiting jobs considered to only those that ended before 1980, considering only jobs with a duration greater than 5 years, considering only participants living within 10km of their recruiting hospital, and considering cumulative exposure ‘dose’ based on summing years in different asbestos exposure risk categories (assigned by job title) at participant level, were all non-significant. In an unplanned secondary analysis we also found a significant association self reported occupational exposure to stone dust and IPF, OR 2.9(1.3-6.7; 0.01).</p>
<p>After controlling for case and smoking status ever a high or medium risk job for asbestos exposure was associated with dyspnoea, measured using ordinal logistic regression and mMRC dyspnoea score, OR 1.44(1.12-1.84; p=0.004). The strength of association between asbestos exposure and dyspnoea increased with increasing categories of asbestos exposure risk. I found evidence suggestive of an interaction between asbestos exposure, as measured by ever having a job at medium or high risk for asbestos exposure, and ever having smoked, on IPF risk, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p=0.04). I found evidence supporting the risk of the interaction between ever smoking and ever having a high or medium risk asbestos exposure job, being mediated by MUC5b promotor variant rs3505950 genotype, OR 4.6 (95%CI 1.5-14, p=0.01) by stratifying for genotype, see Table nineteen. In a sensitivity analysis using a strict case definition of definite UIP the OR for IPF for those exposed to smoking and asbestos was 2.33 (95%CI 1.13-4.8, p=0.02). When using the strict case defintion and stratifying by genotype the OR for IPF for participants who had at least one copy of the minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant and were exposed to smoking and asbestos was 8.56 (95%CI 2.39-30.69, 0.001)</p>

A recent meta-analysis of 12 IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanc2019">[26]</span> that included the studies outlined above did find singificant associations for occupational metal, wood, and stone dust exposures and IPF.

<p>There is accumulating evidence for a MUC5B driven endotype of pulmonary fibrosis in ILD.

<p>A major limitation of our study is that we lack comprehensive data on participation rates. Recruiting centres were provided with screening logs and asked to report monthly the number of of eligible participants identified, approached, and the outcome. For the centres that did provide monthly data (N=3) participation rates were high; fewer than 5% of participants approached declined to enroll in the study with no significant difference between cases and controls. After enrollment 22 of 516 cases(4%), and 45 of 511 controls(9%) were withdrawn because they no longer wished to take part in the study, they did not respond after we called them on three occasions, or we were notified that they had died before the interview took place. This gives an overall participation rate of approximately 91% for cases and 86% for controls. However, recruitment was very poor at several centres, this is likely to reflect that many eligible participants were not invited to participate due to, for example, research staff shortages.</p>
<p>My study has several strengths in comparison to previous case-control studies that have investigated occupational asbestos exposure in IPF. I assessed occupational asbestos exposure in 466 male participants, the largest previous study assessed 149 male participants<span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[34]</span>, and supassed the recruitment target required for adequate power. Risk of selection bias was minimised through the use of hospital controls and randomly sampling outpatient clinics. Assessors were blinded to case-status during the asbestos exposure assessment process and study design and pre-specified outcomes were registered on clincialtrial.gov (NCT03211507). Participants were genotyped for MUC5b promotor variant rs3505950 and two validated means of assessing asbestos exposure were used to permit quantitative and semi-quantitative, and allow assessment for gene-environement and environment-environment interaction.</p>
<p>There is now a need to make use of modern techniques such as Mendelian randomisation (MR) within a population of IPF patients with well characterised occupational exposures. MR is a technique that uses randomly distributed genetic variants as natural experiments to provide evidence about putative causal relations between modifiable risk factors and disease.<span class="citation" data-cites="Davies2018">[154]</span> Through its use of genetic variance it can overcome problems of confounding and reverse causality. MR can be used within a case-control study design to help triangulate suspected causal associations.<span class="citation" data-cites="Lawlor2016">[155]</span> It could be usefully applied to IPFJES, or similar case-control study data, to investigate interactions between occupational silica and asbestos exposure, smoking, and NLRP3 inflammasome variants, with respect to IPF risk, in order to better understand the aetiology of IPF and potentially identify new therapeutic targets.

<h2 id="conclusion-4"><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The majority of men in their 70s in the UK who attend hospital have held a high or medium risk for asbestos exposure job during their working lifetime; estimated asbestos exposure based on validated means inferred by job title or historic asbestos exposure reconstruction methods does not significantly affect risk of IPF. Nonetheless, about 8% of IPF cases have a history of heavy occupational asbestos exposure (&gt;25 fibre-ml.years) that would support a diagnosis of asbestosis based on the Helsinki criteria. Asbestos exposure alone does not appear to be an important cause of IPF. However, asbestos exposure does appear to interact with smoking and the minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant rs35705950 to increase IPF risk and this affect is larger when analysis is limited to cases with definite UIP. Asbestos exposure also appears to be associated with MRC dyspnoea in our study and this association is independant of case and smoking status.</p>

<h2 id="thesis-summary"><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Thesis summary</h2>
<p>This thesis presents the findings of an analysis of UK mortality trends for IPF and asbestos related disease, a review of previous occupational case-control studies of IPF that have investigated occupational exposures in IPF, a review of historic asbestos exposure assessment methods, a review of the IPF genetic susceptibility factor MUC5b promotor region SNP rs35705950, and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).</p>
<p>IPF mortality and asbestos related disease are strongly, if ecologically, correlated and there are several prima facae reasons to suppose that occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognised cause of IPF, namely: it is more common in men and manual workers, it has been associated with occupational metal, wood, and stone dust exposures in several previous studies, and heavy asbestos fibre burdens have been identified in the lung tissue of IPF patients in a small case series.</p>
<p>Historic asbestos exposure assessment is challenging because of a paucity of historic data and variable biopersistence and invitro modification of asbestos fibres. Among the best current validated means are assessment based on job title and the use of known job title related pleural mesothelioma risk as a proxy, and historic exposure reconstruction using source receptor models that provide validated estimates of cumulative asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>The MUC5b promotor region SNP rs357950 is the strongest identified risk factor for IPF. It is associated with higher levels of distal airway MUC5b and is thought to mediate disease by reduced airway clearance and through interaction with airway microbiota.</p>
<p>IPFJES, a large multicentre hospital based case-control study of occupational exposures in IPF, demonstrates that the majority of men in the UK have at least one high or medium risk for asbestos exposure job during their lifetime and about 8% have heavy (&gt;25 fibre-ml.year) asbestos exposure, that this is not significantly associated with IPF risk, and that this association is not modified by rs357950 genotype. IPFJES finds a significant association between occupational asbestos exposure and dyspnoea which is independent of case and smoking status. IPFJES finds a significant interaction between occupational asbestos exposure and smoking which increases risk of IPF, is more marked in patients with definite UIP, and appears to require a minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant rs357950.</p>
<h2 id="future-work"><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> Future work</h2>
<p>Planned future work includes further study of non-asbestos occupational exposures in IPF such as silica, augmentation of the study data with pulmonary function test measurements, a mendelian randomisation study of smoking in IPF, and investigation of whether NLRP3 inflammasome related genes alter the risk of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) in patients with occupational exposure to asbestos or crystalline silica.</p>
