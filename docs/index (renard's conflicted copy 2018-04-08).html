<!-- This is the abstract -->
<p>The question of whether occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognized cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises because it is clinically plausible, epidemiologically plausible, and consistent with fibre studies and case-control data. This thesis examines the question by means of a literature review and a novel hospital based case-control study, the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).</p>

<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2012 was the recorded cause of death for c.4000 people in England and Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5% pa since 2000.<span class="citation">[1]</span> The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).<span class="citation">[2]</span><span class="citation">[3]</span><span class="citation">[4]</span> The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas<span class="citation">[1]</span>, patterns that are not unique to the UK.<span class="citation">[3]</span> The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.<span class="citation">[5]</span><span class="citation">[6]</span></p>
<p>These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.<span class="citation">[7]</span> Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with 'IPF' and revision of the diagnosis to 'asbestosis'.<span class="citation">[8]</span><span class="citation">[9]</span><span class="citation">[10]</span><span class="citation">[11]</span></p>
<p>Identification of occupational asbestos fibre exposure as an under-recognised cause of IPF is important to improve our understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.</p>
<h2 id="aims-and-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Aims and objectives</h2>
<p>My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950).</p>
<p>My specific research questions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF?</li>
<li>Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-sources"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Data sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the literature review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures in IPF I consider all published IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures.</li>
<li>For the mortality analysis I use data obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Health and Safety Executive, and the World Health Organisation Mortality Database.</li>
<li>Brief reviews of asbestos exposure assessment and genetic suceptibility in IPF rely on the published literature.</li>
<li>Primary case-control data collected during my PhD as part of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) is used to analyze asbestos exposure in IPF. (?include navaratum case control jobs data that was shared)</li>

<h2 id="outline-of-thesis"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Outline of thesis</h2>
<p>This chapter (Chapter 1) describes the problem studied, aims and objectives, and approach. Chapter 2 is a literature review and meta-analysis of IPF case-control studies that report on occupational exposure. Chapter 3 is an analysis of IPF and asbestos related disease mortality data. Chapter 4 is a review of asbestos exposure assessment methodology. Chapter 5 is a review of genetic suceptibility in IPF. Chapter 6 describes the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study including results and analysis arising from it. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by summarising it and suggesting future work.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is made in the presence of a usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern on high resolution CT scan or biopsy. The diagnosis requires that known causes of interstitial lung disease (such as drug toxicity, connective tissue disease, domestic, and occupational or environmental exposures) be excluded.<span class="citation">[12]</span></p>
<p>Attributing a disease process to a specific exposure can be difficult. Disease processes are frequently complex or multifactorial, depending on the interaction of genetic and environmental components. Well-studied and relatively frequent entities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes lend themselves to epidemiologic investigation, delineating the major risk factors for disease and their relative contributions to risk at the population level. IPF presents an additional challenge to attribution; because of its relative infrequency, epidemiologic study of the disease is largely limited to case-control studies.<span class="citation">[13]</span> Studying specific occupational exposures also presents its own challenges; co-exposure is common, occupational hygeine data is frequently limited and self-reported exposure is prone to recall bias.</p>
<p>I identified several review articles of the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease that do not necessarily focus on IPF and only briefly mention occupational factors (e.g Ley2013<span class="citation">[3]</span>). Here I consider review articles that specifically deal with occupational factors in IPF and cite the case-control studies used.</p>
<p>Turner-Warwick (1998) discusses potential difficulties in establishing attribution and causality in IPF. She observes that there is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied to exclude IPF; some clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential cause is identified, others only when there is clear exposure to an established cause. She explains that diagnosis based on radiologic and clinical findings, and not on lung biopsy or bronchioalveolar lavage, may result in initiating agents for disease being overlooked. Further, that exposures such as asbestos, silica, coal, graphite, hard metal, and avian proteins, may result in disease that can not be differentiated from IPF.<span class="citation">[14]</span></p>
<p>Reviewing the epidemiology of IPF and case-control studies to date Hubbard (2001) describes the association of IPF with occupational exposures to metal and wood and estimates that 10% of IPF cases may be due to occupational metal exposure and 5% of cases to wood.<span class="citation">[15]</span></p>
<p>Taskar and Coultas (2006) review and carry out a meta-analysis of six case-control studies investigating environmental and occupational exposures in IPF. They report population attributable risk percentages for agriculture and farming (20.8%), livestock (4.1%), wood dust (5%), metal dust (3.4%), stone/sand/silica (3.5%), and smoking (49.1%).<span class="citation">[16]</span></p>
<p>Gulati and Redlich’s (2015) review of exposures causing usual interstitial pneumonia highlights that asbestosis may appear indistinguishable from IPF and summarises previous case-control studies but did not pool studies to perform a meta-analysis.<span class="citation">[17]</span></p>
<p>I sought to identify and meta-analyze all IPF case-control studies dealing with occupational exposures.</p>
<h2 id="method"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>Pubmed, embase, and google scholar search engines were searched for combinations of the terms 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'occupation', 'case-control study' and synonyms. When relevant papers were identified papers referenced and papers citing the paper were reviewed. Medline ranker<span class="citation">[18]</span> and bespoke pubmed 'mining' techniques<span class="citation">[19]</span> were also used.</p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed and abstracted data for five exposure categories common to the identified case-control studies: “vapors, gases, dusts, and/or fumes (VGDF)”, “metal dust”, “wood dust”, “silica dust”, and “agricultural dust”. We calculated PAF as follows: PAF=pc(OR - 1)/OR, where pc is the proportion of cases exposed and OR is the risk estimate.</p>
<p>We calculated pooled OR and pooled PAF for occupational exposures using fixed effects models and random effects models in Stata. When there was results of the models differed substantively, we used the results of the fixed effects model, which were more conservative. The pooled PAF relied on the ratio of attributable cases to all cases underlying each risk estimate.</p>
<h2 id="results"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>We found (as of May 2017) 14 case-control studies looking at occupational exposures in IPF (Table 3.1) the most recent review article covers only eight of them. Associations with metal, wood, silica, and agricultural dust were reported. <span class="citation">[20]</span><span class="citation">[21]</span> <span class="citation">[22]</span> <span class="citation">[23]</span> <span class="citation">[24]</span> <span class="citation">[25]</span> <span class="citation">[26]</span> <span class="citation">[27]</span> <span class="citation">[28]</span> <span class="citation">[29]</span> <span class="citation">[30]</span> <span class="citation">[31]</span></p>
<p>43 risk estimates from 14 publications (2027 IPF cases in total) were used. Each exposure category was assessed with 6-11 risk estimates (Table 3.2).</p>


<h2 id="discussion"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>tables above will need updating becaue of gremlins</p>
<p>Our results support the case for a proportion of IPF cases being attributable to occupational exposures.</p>
<p>Pooled ORs were significantly elevated for VGDF, metal dust, wood dust, agricultural dust, and silica dust; the pooled PAF estimates by category ranged from 4-23%. This is an important finding for an otherwise idiopathic disease which carries significant morbidity and mortality; identifying causal occupational agents would permit remidiation and prevention.</p>
<p>Associations between IPF and wood, metal, and agricultural dust were previouly reported in a meta-analysis of six case-control studies by Taskar and Coultas. <span class="citation">[16]</span> While our findings are similar we found a smaller effect size for agricultural exposure and a large effect size for non-specific vapours, gases, dust, and fumes (VGDF), see Table 3.2.</p>
<p>Funnel plot asymmetry using Egger's test, which may be due to publication bias, was present for VGDF (p = 0.04) and metal dust (p = 0.03) but not for wood dust (p = 0.09), silica dust (p = 0.2), and agricultural dust (p = 0.6). However, the number of studies included is small and funnel plot assymetry may be due to chance rather than bias.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the meta-analysis that arise from the case-control studies included.</p>
<p>Several studies <span class="citation">[20]</span> <span class="citation">[32]</span> <span class="citation">[24]</span> <span class="citation">[26]</span> <span class="citation">[28]</span> used population controls but do not provide details on participation rates. Participation rates can be low for community controls; a recent UK case-control study investigating prothrombotic factors in IPF reported a response rate of 28% for commumnity controls. <span class="citation">[33]</span> This approach is vulnerable to non-responder bias. One study<span class="citation">[34]</span> used employee occupational records and death certificates from pension-fund records for a single company and was only able to locate the occupational records for 40% of cases and 38% of controls.</p>
<p>Nearly all studies relied on self-reported exposures rather than life time occupational histories to assess exposure; an approach that is prone to recall bias and does not permit examination of dose-response relationships.</p>
<p>Reliance of self-reported exposures also means that studies are potentially vulnerable to confounding as a result of co-exposure. For example, several studies have described strong associations between metal work and IPF and specify sheet metal workers<span class="citation">[21]</span><span class="citation">[20]</span><span class="citation">[34]</span>, a group who are frequently exposed to dust containing asbestos fibres<span class="citation">[35]</span> and who in a recent UK study, had the highest risk of mesothelioma.<span class="citation">[36]</span></p>
<p>Case definitions and sources for cases varied between studies. For example Scott (1990)<span class="citation">[20]</span> used a case definition which included a chest radiograph showing bilateral interstitial shadowing whereas most other studies relied on high resolution CT. Four studies used mortality data <span class="citation">[21]</span><span class="citation">[37]</span><span class="citation">[26]</span><span class="citation">[34]</span> to identify cases and one study<span class="citation">[26]</span> used a national register of patients recieving oxygen therapy. Differences in healthcare coverage and coding practices can result in selection bias.<span class="citation">[38]</span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The observed excess risk could represent disease misclassification of pneumoconiosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but this is unlikely to fully explain the observed effects. Our analysis supports an etiologic role for occupational exposures in IPF, potentially explaining up to 23% of the burden of disease and highlighting a role for workplace exposure reduction in disease prevention.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The incidence of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been increasing at a rate of 5% per annum since 2000. By definition, the diagnosis of IPF is not made in the presence of an identifiable cause. However, the distribution of the disease in the population (more common in men, manual workers, and those living in more industrial areas of the country) suggests a causal contribution from an occupational or environmental source.</p>
<p>It is hypothesised that a proportion of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) cases are due to occult environmental or occupational exposures to asbestos dust. This would be expected to result in a spatio-temporal association between IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis mortality patterns coinciding with asbestos exposure. It would also be expected to produce a birth cohort effect</p>
<p>Our aim was to examine trends in IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis mortality data for evidence of cohort effect and association.</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>Regional age and sex stratified mortality data for IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis were obtained for England and Wales from the Office of National Statistics for the period 1974–2012. Data were age-standardised and visualised using the Python Pandas data analysis library and matplotlib.</p>
<h2 id="results-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>IPF mortality continues to rise. Female:Male is approximately 1:1.6. There are more IPF deaths in the North West and South East of England. IPF mortality does appear to correlate with mesothelioma mortality (Figure ). There is evidence of a cohort effect with age-specific IPF death rates increasing in successive cohorts, most clearly seen from age 60 (Figure ). While overall rates were higher for men but there were not marked sex differences in cohort mortality trends.</p>

Reviews asbestos exposure assessment with particular reference to using job titles and cherries thingy and attribution

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

what is exposure? biological exposure etc

<h2 id="introduction-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic.</p>
<p>Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung they can be sampled by lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or at autopsy.</p>
<p>Historic workplace measurments are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurment technique at the time of assessment; they do not necessarily generalize well.</p>
<p>Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.<span class="citation">[39]</span></p>
<p>Expert assessment and exposure modelling approaches integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.<span class="citation">[40]</span></p>
<p>Job-exposure matricies (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title.</p>
<p>Finally, self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to, these are usually elicited by questionnaire or at interview.</p>
<p>The asbestos exposure assessment literature presents difficulties for review because it is large and recognised to be at risk of bias as a result of its economic importance to powerful industrial and medicolegal actors<span class="citation">[41]</span>.</p>
<p>Here we critically review different means of asbestos exposure assessment and consider their clinical and research utility.</p>
<h2 id="method-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of &quot;asbestos&quot;, &quot;exposure assessment&quot;, together with terms for modes of assessment including &quot;lung biopsy&quot;, &quot;bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;, &quot;exposure reconstruction&quot;, and &quot;job-exposure matrix&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="results-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Results</h2>
<h3 id="lung-biopsy-and-bronchoalveolar-lavage"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage</h3>
<p>The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust<span class="citation">[42]</span> included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundent asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis.</p>
<p>The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestos exposure because fibres, particularly chyrostile fibres, may be cleared from the lung and counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.<span class="citation">[39]</span></p>
<p>Despite this recent 2014 Helsinki guidelines<span class="citation">[43]</span> and UK Royal College of Pathologist guidelines appear to suggest that a clear history of substantial occupational asbestos exposure is insufficient for diagnosis and that the absence of asbestos bodies or fibre counts above a certain threshold might be used to rule out a the diagnosis. The shortcomings of such an approach highlighted above are also described by responses to the Helsinki guideline.<span class="citation">[44]</span><span class="citation">[45]</span><span class="citation">[46]</span></p>
<p>Lung biopsy carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function and it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Baur2014"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> Therefore, the clinical utility of lung biospy and bronchoalveolar lavage is limited to ruling in asbestosis when a suggestive exposure history and radiology are lacking.</p>
<p>In a research context lung biopsy and brochoalveolar lavage have provided valuable population level insights. Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls. Fibre counts were found to be higher in groups with greater occupational risk (as defined by PMR), providing additional support for the pre-eminance of an occupational history.<span class="citation">[36]</span><span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Gilham2015"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> In a follow up study asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to demonstrated that population amphibole burden is falling and is proportional to mesothelioma mortality.<span class="citation">[47]</span></p>
<p>A similar correlation with occupational exposure history, overall downward trend in fibre counts, and a significant false negative rate has been observed in a recent Belgian study of patients undergoing bronchoscopy with broncheoalvelolar lavage sampling for asbestos fibre quantification.<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Nuyts2016"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
<h3 id="historic-workplace-measurements"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Historic workplace measurements</h3>
<p>Occupational hygenists have recorded a large numbers of workplace measurements of asbestos in different settings, at different times, using a variety of different means. These measurements reside in national databases such as the HSE National Exposure Database<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Burns1989"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>, and EV@LUTIL<span class="citation">[48]</span>, in the published literature, and in unpublished company records.</p>
<p>The use of different means of making workplace assessments results in difficulties with respect to the accuracy and comparability of measurements. For example, instruments that count particles rather than asbestos fibres have been used and there is no established conversion factor.<span class="citation">[49]</span> Phase contrast microscopy has also been used which is less sensitive that scanning electron microscopy, which is in turn less senisitive than transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ATSDR2001"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
<p>Where era and task specific workplace exposure data matching a particular patient occupational history is available and readily identiable it is a valuable means of assessing exposure history. Unfortunately, this is a rare occurence.</p>
<p>Measurements have found greater utility in a research setting where they can help to quantify risk and inform regulatory policy and compliance in specific workplace settings, for example, in car mechanics<span class="citation">[50]</span> or skilled craftsmen.<span class="citation">[51]</span></p>
<h3 id="exposure-reconstruction"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Exposure reconstruction</h3>
<p>Sahmel et al<span class="citation">[52]</span> propose a seven-step framework (see Figure ) which they use to enumerate and critique exposure reconstuction approaches.</p>
<p>Reconstruction techniques may be quanitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitive. Quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on data from similar (historic or current) exposure scenarios or simulation studies. Semi-quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on exposure data matrices (using a job-exposure matrix) and/or exposure determinants (using an exposure model). Qualatative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on the expert judgement of an industrial hygeinist and self reported exposures.</p>

<h4 id="job-exposure-matrices"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.1</span> Job-exposure matrices</h4>
<p>Several job-exposure matrices that deal with asbestos have been reported. Pannett et al's 1985 job-exposure matrix for use in population studies in England and Wales<span class="citation">[53]</span> found good agreement between job-title assigned categories of exposure (none, low, moderate, high) for asbestos and direct review of the original occupational history by an expert.</p>
<p>Rake et al<span class="citation">[36]</span> assigned catergories risk of exposure (low, medium, high) using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation. This approach has been validated in the same cohort by amphibole fibre counts.<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Gilham2015"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
<p>DOM-JEM<span class="citation">[54]</span> was developed for use in population based multi-centre lung cancer case-control study. It assigns job titles one of three categories of asbestos exposure (no exposure, low exposure, high exposure) based on the consensus of three independent expert rators. DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment () but less hetrogenetiy. In a study applying DOM-JEM to the Netherlands Cohort Study (NCS) DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (K = 0.29).<span class="citation">[55]</span></p>
<p>The Finish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Kauppinen2014"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> covers exposure to 84 different agents, including asbestos, for 311 jobs across 9 periods spaning 1945-2015. Era-specific estimates of the mean level of asbestos exposure are available for 27 jobs based on expert assessment and measurement data; the exact details of the grounds for estimates are kept in a proprietary FINJEM database which is not freely available. FINJEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure () but reasonable identification of mesothelioma risk when evaluated using the NCS.<span class="citation">[55]</span><span class="citation">[56]</span></p>
<p>AsbJEM<span class="citation">[57]</span> was developed in Australia by an expert panel of three industrial hygeinists using all available exposure data. It is based on FINJEM and provides quantitative estimates of annual exposure for 224 occupations across three time periods spanning 1943 to 2004. It also showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure ()</p>
<p>SYN-JEM<span class="citation">[58]</span> describes a JEM developed for four carcinogens. It provides quantified asbestos exposure estimates based on 27958 personal measurements (spanning 1971-2009), a mixed effects statistical model, and an a priori categorical assessment of exposure (none, low, high). Cherrie et al<span class="citation">[59]</span> point out that SYN-JEM provides little contrast in the modelled exposure level between categories as the geometric mean for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml and that there are wide variations in regional estimates that are difficult to explain.</p>
<p>JEMS are generally taken to be superior to direct questions about exposures because they are cheaper, have greater validity, and are less vulnerable to differntial recall. This is because recall of occupations is not influenced by disease status, coding of occupation is blind to case-control status, and translation of codes into exposure is standardized and can not be influence by disease status of a subject.<span class="citation">[60]</span><span class="citation">[61]</span><span class="citation">[62]</span></p>
<p>Orlowski et al<span class="citation">[63]</span> compared two JEMs with a structured job specific questionnaire (SQ) in a lung cancer case-control study. They found that agreement between the JEMs and the SQ was poor () and suggested that the sources of error for JEMs were loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and the insuffuciency of published data on occupational asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>JEMs are not routinely used in clinical practice because they are not usually available or accessible for specific patients. In a research setting they are frequently helpful though in addition to the strengths and weaknesses outlined about the desirability of reusing an existing JEM vs developing a study specific JEM must be considered.</p>
<h4 id="exposure-modelling-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Exposure modelling approaches</h4>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches modify existing measurment data on the basis of knowledge of the determinants of exposure.</p>
<p>A common conceptual framework for this is the source-receptor model (?link a pic) source receptor model<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tielemans2008"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span><span class="citation">[64]</span> wherby inhalation exposure is considered in terms of an exposure source, a pathway from source to receptor, and the receptor. The model is then used to propose modifying factors such as activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection.<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tielemans2008"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>.</p>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches make strong intuitive sense; it is known that there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures<span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Symanski2006"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> and, for example, room size and ventillation have been empirically shown to affect the concentration of airborne chemical exposures.<span class="citation">[65]</span> Further, mathmatical exposure models that take account of known exposure modifying factors to estimate past exposures have shown a good correlation with measured values.<span class="citation">[40]</span></p>
<p>A quantified validated historic asbestos exposure model<span class="citation">[59]</span> has recently been developed and proposed as a means of for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The approach has the advantage, compared with job-exposure matrices, of providing a more granular quantified exposure assessment, sensitive to the exposure circumstances of the individual. However, the approach is limited by the fact that the individual must recall that they must recall their exposure circumstances which due to the latency of asbestos related disease may have occurred over 30 years ago. The approach is also limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for validation, though is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data.</p>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches to assessing asbestos exposure have research and clinical utility notwithstanding the limitations outlined above together with the requirement that assessors be appropriately trained.</p>
<h4 id="self-reported-exposure"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.3</span> Self-reported exposure</h4>
<p>Self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to. Typically this is elicited by asking about a specific exposure via questionnaire or interview. Differential recall of self-reported exposures according to disease status is a concern but few studies have found evidence of this and it appears to be less of an issue when prompted responses, rather than volunteered, responses about occupational exposures are used.<span class="citation">[66]</span></p>
<p>Most studies comparing self-reported exposures to industrial hygeine measurements have found significant associations but with wide variation in the proportions of variance explained by the self reports. This is not surprising given that it is known there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures. <span class="citation">[61]</span><span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Symanski2006"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
<p>Studies comparing self-reported exposures to expert assessment find hightly variable levels of agreement () with a median  of 0.6. In two studies comparing self-reported exposures with JEMs, self-reported exposures were more sensitive and of similar or worse specificity. <span class="citation">[61]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have been shown to be more accurate for easily sensed exposures such as solvents with a strong smell, dusts with larger particle sizes, and vibrations that can be felt. Providing a reference point, for example using well known machines from a workplace to gauge noise category also improves accuracy.<span class="citation">[61]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have clinical utility in that they can suggest or support consideration of an occupational cause for disease. Ideally such self-reports are combined with the clinicians knowledge of the likely occupational exposures given the occupational history and other available data to strengthen or weaken the case as appropriate. Similarly, they have utility in a research setting where they may augment other means of assessment.</p>

The minor-allele of the rs35705950 SNP in the mucin 5B gene was found to be present in 38% of IPF patients but just 9% of controls.<span class="citation">[69]</span> The polymorphism results in excess MUC5B protein in the airway, impaired clearance of inhaled substances and a chronic inflammatory burden on the alveolar surface.<span class="citation">[69]</span> The association is allele dose-dependent, has been replicated in independent cohorts, and appears to confer improved survival.<span class="citation">[3]</span><span class="citation">[69]</span><span class="citation">[70]</span> Two large GWASs have confirmed the observed associations of IPF with MUC5B and other loci.<span class="citation">[71]</span><span class="citation">[72]</span></p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>My study will be a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study. Participants will be recruited from a UK network of six confirmed centres. Cases will be men who present, between 07.2017 and 07.2019, with a new diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria<span class="citation">[73]</span>; they will be identified monthly by the MDT coordinator of participating centres.<span class="citation">[74]</span></p>
<p>For each case, four controls, frequency-matched on age, will be randomly selected from incident outpatient attendances (not confined to respiratory) who do not have a diagnosis of IPF and are from the hospital as the case. Monthly lists of outpatient attendances will be obtained using the patient administration systems of participating centres. 120 cases and 480 controls will be recruited over two years with four participants enrolled and interviewed per day.</p>
<p>Eligible participants will be contacted by telephone and invited to participate. An interviewer will collect data on demographics, lifetime occupational history, hobbies, family medical history, and smoking using a structured web-based questionnaire designed by us to collect lifetime occupational histories. This approach will facilitate coding, allow input validation, and permit questions to be tailored to pre-specified conditions. The questions will be developed in collaboration with an international expert in asbestos exposure measurement, Dr John Cherrie of the IOM. Participants will be invited to provide a venous blood sample for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>Cases and controls will be genotyped using a panel of 15 pre-defined candidate susceptibility SNPs including rs35705950. Genotyping will be undertaken using Q-PCR and Taqman assays on DNA isolated from whole blood samples.</p>
<p>For the primary analysis unconditional logistic regression will be used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. Prior data<span class="citation">[36]</span> indicate that the probability of exposure among controls is 0.29. If the true OR for disease in exposed subjects relative to unexposed subjects is 2.0, I will need to recruit 94 case patients and 376 control patients to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this odds ratio equals 1 with  and <span class="citation">[75]</span>; my planned sample size sample size includes a margin for model stability and incomplete data.<span class="citation">[76]</span></p>
<p>Secondary (exploratory) analysis will investigate gene-environment interaction. The global minor allele frequency of MUC5B rs35705950 is 0.05.<span class="citation">[77]</span> With an estimated prevalence of IPF of 20/100000<span class="citation">[1]</span> and with ORs 2.0 for asbestos exposure and 6.8 for rs35705950<span class="citation">[69]</span>, 113 cases would be required to detect a minimum interaction OR of 4.0.<span class="citation">[78]</span> While I acknowledge that this exploratory analysis will have the power to detect only a large effect size it seems a valuable opportunity to examine an unexplored area in IPF research.</p>
