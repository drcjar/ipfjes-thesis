<!-- This is the abstract -->
<p>The question of whether occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognized cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises because it is clinically plausible, epidemiologically plausible, and consistent with fibre studies and case-control data. This thesis examines the question by means of a literature review and a novel hospital based case-control study, the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).</p>

<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2012 was the recorded cause of death for c.4000 people in England and Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5% pa since 2000.<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2011">[1]</span> The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).<span class="citation" data-cites="Maher2012">[2]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[3]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Spagnolo2014">[4]</span> The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas<span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2011">[1]</span>, patterns that are not unique to the UK.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[3]</span> The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1998">[5]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Vancheri2010">[6]</span></p>
<p>These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.<span class="citation" data-cites="Barber2015">[7]</span> Clinical, radiological and histopathological findings in asbestosis and IPF are similar<span class="citation" data-cites="Corrin1985">[8]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Copley2003">[9]</span>. Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with ‘IPF’ and revision of the diagnosis to ‘asbestosis’.<span class="citation" data-cites="Monso1990">[10]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Monso1991">[11]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Glazer2009">[12]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ghio2014">[13]</span></p>
<p>Identification of occupational asbestos fibre exposure as an under-recognised cause of IPF is important to improve our understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.</p>
<h2 id="aims-and-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Aims and objectives</h2>
<p>My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950).</p>
<p>My specific research questions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF?</li>
<li>Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-sources"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Data sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the literature review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures in IPF I consider all published IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures.</li>
<li>For the mortality analysis I use data obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Health and Safety Executive, and the World Health Organisation Mortality Database.</li>
<li>Brief reviews of asbestos exposure assessment and genetic suceptibility in IPF rely on the published literature.</li>
<li>Primary case-control data collected during my PhD as part of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) is used to analyze asbestos exposure in IPF. (?include navaratum case control jobs data that was shared)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outline-of-thesis"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Outline of thesis</h2>
<p>This chapter (Chapter 1) describes the problem studied, aims and objectives, and approach. Chapter 2 is a literature review and meta-analysis of IPF case-control studies that report on occupational exposure. Chapter 3 is an analysis of IPF and asbestos related disease mortality data. Chapter 4 is a review of asbestos exposure assessment methodology. Chapter 5 is a review of genetic suceptibility in IPF. Chapter 6 describes the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study including results and analysis arising from it. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by summarising it and suggesting future work.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is made in the presence of a usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern on high resolution CT scan or biopsy. The diagnosis requires that known causes of interstitial lung disease (such as drug toxicity, connective tissue disease, domestic, and occupational or environmental exposures) be excluded.<span class="citation" data-cites="Travis2013">[14]</span></p>
<p>Attributing a disease process to a specific exposure can be difficult. Disease processes are frequently complex or multifactorial, depending on the interaction of genetic and environmental components. Well-studied and relatively frequent entities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes lend themselves to epidemiologic investigation, delineating the major risk factors for disease and their relative contributions to risk at the population level. IPF presents an additional challenge to attribution; because of its relative infrequency, epidemiologic study of the disease is largely limited to case-control studies.<span class="citation" data-cites="Reynolds2017">[15]</span> Studying specific occupational exposures also presents its own challenges; co-exposure is common, occupational hygeine data is frequently limited and self-reported exposure is prone to recall bias.</p>
<p>I identified several review articles of the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease that do not necessarily focus on IPF and only briefly mention occupational factors (e.g Ley2013<span class="citation" data-cites="Ley2013">[3]</span>). Here I consider review articles that specifically deal with occupational factors in IPF and cite the case-control studies used.</p>
<p>Turner-Warwick (1998) discusses potential difficulties in establishing attribution and causality in IPF. She observes that there is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied to exclude IPF; some clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential cause is identified, others only when there is clear exposure to an established cause. She explains that diagnosis based on radiologic and clinical findings, and not on lung biopsy or bronchioalveolar lavage, may result in initiating agents for disease being overlooked. Further, that exposures such as asbestos, silica, coal, graphite, hard metal, and avian proteins, may result in disease that can not be differentiated from IPF.<span class="citation" data-cites="Turner-Warwick1998">[16]</span></p>
<p>Reviewing the epidemiology of IPF and case-control studies to date Hubbard (2001) describes the association of IPF with occupational exposures to metal and wood and estimates that 10% of IPF cases may be due to occupational metal exposure and 5% of cases to wood.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2001">[17]</span></p>
<p>Taskar and Coultas (2006) review and carry out a meta-analysis of six case-control studies investigating environmental and occupational exposures in IPF. They report population attributable risk percentages for agriculture and farming (20.8%), livestock (4.1%), wood dust (5%), metal dust (3.4%), stone/sand/silica (3.5%), and smoking (49.1%).<span class="citation" data-cites="Taskar2006">[18]</span></p>
<p>Gulati and Redlich’s (2015) review of exposures causing usual interstitial pneumonia highlights that asbestosis may appear indistinguishable from IPF and summarises previous case-control studies but did not pool studies to perform a meta-analysis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gulati2015">[19]</span></p>
<p>I sought to identify and meta-analyze all IPF case-control studies dealing with occupational exposures.</p>
<h2 id="method"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>Pubmed, embase, and google scholar search engines were searched for combinations of the terms ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’, ‘occupation’, ‘case-control study’ and synonyms. When a relevant papers was identified papers referenced and papers citing the paper were reviewed. Medline ranker<span class="citation" data-cites="Fontaine2009">[20]</span> and bespoke pubmed ‘mining’ techniques<span class="citation" data-cites="Reynolds2017pubmed">[21]</span> were also used.</p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed and abstracted data for five exposure categories common to the identified case-control studies: “vapors, gases, dusts, and/or fumes (VGDF)”, “metal dust”, “wood dust”, “silica dust”, and “agricultural dust”. We calculated PAF as follows: PAF=pc(OR - 1)/OR, where pc is the proportion of cases exposed and OR is the risk estimate.</p>
<p>We calculated pooled OR and pooled PAF for occupational exposures using fixed effects models and random effects models in Stata. When there was results of the models differed substantively, we used the results of the fixed effects model, which were more conservative. The pooled PAF relied on the ratio of attributable cases to all cases underlying each risk estimate.</p>
<h2 id="results"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>We found (as of May 2017) 15 case-control studies looking at occupational exposures in IPF the most recent review article covers only eight of them. Associations with metal, wood, silica, and agricultural dust were reported. <span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[22]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[23]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996a">[24]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Mullen1998">[25]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[26]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[27]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[28]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[29]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Pinheiro2008">[30]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-SanchoFigueroa2010">[31]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-Sancho2011">[32]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Awadalla2012">[33]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[34]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Ekstrom2014">[35]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[36]</span></p>
<p>40 risk estimates from 12 publications (1326 IPF cases in total) were used (Table 3.1)<span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[22]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996a">[24]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Mullen1998">[25]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[26]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[27]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Miyake2005">[28]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[29]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-SanchoFigueroa2010">[31]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-Sancho2011">[32]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Awadalla2012">[33]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Paolocci2013">[34]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Koo2017">[36]</span></p>
<p>Three studies were not used, one because data was not collected on the proportion of cases with specific occupational exposures<span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[23]</span>, one because of methodological differences in exposure assignment<span class="citation" data-cites="Pinheiro2008">[30]</span>, and one because if reported data for pulmonary fibrosis rather than IPF.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ekstrom2014">[35]</span></p>
<p>Each exposure category was assessed with 6-11 risk estimates (Table 3.2).</p>

<h2 id="discussion"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>Our results support the case for a proportion of IPF cases being attributable to occupational exposures.</p>
<p>Pooled ORs were significantly elevated for VGDF, metal dust, wood dust, agricultural dust, and silica dust; the pooled PAF estimates by category ranged from 4-23%. This is an important finding for an otherwise idiopathic disease which carries significant morbidity and mortality; identifying causal occupational agents would permit remidiation and prevention.</p>
<p>Associations between IPF and wood, metal, and agricultural dust were previouly reported in a meta-analysis of six case-control studies by Taskar and Coultas. <span class="citation" data-cites="Taskar2006">[18]</span> While our findings are similar we found a smaller effect size for agricultural exposure and a large effect size for non-specific vapours, gases, dust, and fumes (VGDF), see Table 3.2.</p>
<p>Funnel plot asymmetry using Egger’s test, which may be due to publication bias, was present for VGDF (p = 0.04) and metal dust (p = 0.03) but not for wood dust (p = 0.09), silica dust (p = 0.2), and agricultural dust (p = 0.6). However, the number of studies included is small and funnel plot assymetry may be due to chance rather than bias.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the meta-analysis that arise from the case-control studies included.</p>
<p>Several studies <span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[22]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard1996">[37]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Baumgartner2000">[26]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[29]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia-Sancho2011">[32]</span> used population controls but do not provide details on participation rates. Participation rates can be low for community controls; a recent UK case-control study investigating prothrombotic factors in IPF reported a response rate of 28% for commumnity controls. <span class="citation" data-cites="Navaratnam2014">[38]</span> This approach is vulnerable to non-responder bias. One study<span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[27]</span> used employee occupational records and death certificates from pension-fund records for a single company and was only able to locate the occupational records for 40% of cases and 38% of controls.</p>
<p>Nearly all studies relied on self-reported exposures rather than life time occupational histories to assess exposure; an approach that is prone to recall bias and does not permit examination of dose-response relationships.</p>
<p>Reliance of self-reported exposures also means that studies are potentially vulnerable to confounding as a result of co-exposure. For example, several studies have described strong associations between metal work and IPF and specify sheet metal workers<span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[23]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[22]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[27]</span>, a group who are frequently exposed to dust containing asbestos fibres<span class="citation" data-cites="Welch1994">[39]</span> and who in a recent UK study, had the highest risk of mesothelioma.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[40]</span></p>
<p>Case definitions and sources for cases varied between studies. For example Scott (1990)<span class="citation" data-cites="Scott1990">[22]</span> used a case definition which included a chest radiograph showing bilateral interstitial shadowing whereas most other studies relied on high resolution CT. Four studies used mortality data <span class="citation" data-cites="Iwai1994">[23]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Pinheiro2008">[30]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[29]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbard2000">[27]</span> to identify cases and one study<span class="citation" data-cites="Gustafson2007">[29]</span> used a national register of patients recieving oxygen therapy. Differences in healthcare coverage and coding practices can result in selection bias.<span class="citation" data-cites="Caminati2015">[41]</span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The observed excess risk could represent disease misclassification of pneumoconiosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but this is unlikely to fully explain the observed effects. Our analysis supports an etiologic role for occupational exposures in IPF, potentially explaining up to 23% of the burden of disease and highlighting a role for workplace exposure reduction in disease prevention.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The incidence of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been increasing at a rate of 5% per annum since 2000. By definition, the diagnosis of IPF is not made in the presence of an identifiable cause. However, the distribution of the disease in the population (more common in men, manual workers, and those living in more industrial areas of the country) suggests a causal contribution from an occupational or environmental source.</p>
<p>It is hypothesised that a proportion of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) cases are due to occult environmental or occupational exposures to asbestos dust. This would be expected to result in a spatio-temporal association between IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis mortality patterns coinciding with asbestos exposure. It would also be expected to produce a birth cohort effect.</p>
<p>Our aim was to examine trends in IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis mortality data for evidence of cohort effect and association.</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>Regional age and sex stratified mortality data for IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis were obtained for England and Wales from the Office of National Statistics for the period 1974–2012. Data were age-standardised and visualised using the Python Pandas data analysis library and matplotlib.</p>
<h2 id="results-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>IPF mortality continues to rise. Female:Male is approximately 1:1.6. There are more IPF deaths in the North West and South East of England. IPF mortality does appear to correlate with mesothelioma mortality (Figure ). There is evidence of a cohort effect with age-specific IPF death rates increasing in successive cohorts, most clearly seen from age 60 (Figure ). While overall rates were higher for men but there were not marked sex differences in cohort mortality trends.</p>

Reviews asbestos exposure assessment with particular reference to using job titles and cherries thingy and attribution

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

?should we have a separate section for "qualatative" assessment by hygeinst

do i need to go into biopersistance more

what is exposure? biological exposure etc

<h2 id="introduction-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic.</p>
<p>Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung they can be sampled by lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or at autopsy.</p>
<p>Historic workplace measurements are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurement technique at the time of assessment; they do not necessarily generalize well.</p>
<p>Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeVuyst1998">[42]</span></p>
<p>Expert assessment and exposure modelling approaches integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999">[43]</span></p>
<p>Job-exposure matrices (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title.</p>
<p>Finally, self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to, these are usually elicited by questionnaire or at interview.</p>
<p>The asbestos exposure assessment literature presents difficulties for review because it is large and recognised to be at risk of bias as a result of its economic importance to powerful industrial and medicolegal actors<span class="citation" data-cites="Nemery2017">[44]</span>.</p>
<p>Here we critically review different means of historic asbestos exposure assessment and consider their clinical and research utility.</p>
<h2 id="method-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Method</h2>
<p>We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of “asbestos”, “exposure assessment”, together with terms for modes of assessment including “lung biopsy”, “bronchoalveolar lavage”, “exposure reconstruction”, and “job-exposure matrix”. When a relevant papers was identified, papers referenced, and papers citing, the paper were reviewed.</p>
<h2 id="results-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Results</h2>
<h3 id="lung-biopsy-and-bronchoalveolar-lavage"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage</h3>
<p>The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust<span class="citation" data-cites="Cooke1924">[45]</span> included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundant asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis.</p>
<p>The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestos exposure because fibres, particularly chrysotile fibres, may be cleared from the lung and counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeVuyst1998">[42]</span></p>
<p>Despite this recent 2014 Helsinki guidelines<span class="citation" data-cites="Wolff2015">[46]</span> and UK Royal College of Pathologists guidelines appear to suggest that a clear history of substantial occupational asbestos exposure is insufficient for diagnosis and that the absence of asbestos bodies or fibre counts above a certain threshold might be used to rule out the diagnosis. The shortcomings of such an approach highlighted above are also described by responses to the Helsinki guideline.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hammar2015">[47]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2016">[48]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2017">[49]</span></p>
<p>Lung biopsy carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function and it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.<span class="citation" data-cites="Baur2016">[48]</span> Therefore, the clinical utility of lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage is limited to ruling in asbestosis when a suggestive exposure history and radiology are lacking.</p>
<p>In a research context lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage have provided valuable population level insights. Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls. Fibre counts were found to be higher in groups with greater occupational risk (as defined by PMR), providing additional support for the pre-eminence of an occupational history.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[40]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[50]</span> In a follow up study asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to demonstrated that population amphibole burden is falling and is proportional to mesothelioma mortality.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2018">[51]</span></p>
<p>A similar correlation with occupational exposure history, overall downward trend in fibre counts, and a significant false negative rate has been observed in a recent Belgian study of patients undergoing bronchoscopy with broncheoalvelolar lavage sampling for asbestos fibre quantification.<span class="citation" data-cites="Nuyts2017">[52]</span></p>
<h3 id="historic-workplace-measurements"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Historic workplace measurements</h3>
<p>Occupational hygienists have recorded a large numbers of workplace measurements of asbestos in different settings, at different times, using a variety of different means. These measurements reside in national databases such as the HSE National Exposure Database<span class="citation" data-cites="Burns1989">[53]</span>, and EV@LUTIL<span class="citation" data-cites="Orlowski2015">[54]</span>, in the published literature, and in unpublished company records.</p>
<p>The use of different means of making workplace assessments results in difficulties with respect to the accuracy and comparability of measurements. For example, instruments that count particles rather than asbestos fibres have been used and there is no established conversion factor.<span class="citation" data-cites="Peto1985">[55]</span> Phase contrast microscopy has also been used which is less sensitive that scanning electron microscopy, which is in turn less sensitive than transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.<span class="citation" data-cites="ATSDR2001">[56]</span></p>
<p>Where era and task specific workplace exposure data matching a particular patient occupational history is available and readily deniable it is a valuable means of assessing exposure history. Unfortunately, in practice measurements are usually limited to the subset of jobs thought to be potentially harmful “high” exposure jobs at the time of measurement. As awareness of the sources and harm of asbestos exposure has developed overtime the available data, until the use of asbestos was banned in the UK, is also skewed to more recent times.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[57]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[58]</span></p>
<p>Measurements have found greater utility in a research setting where they can help to quantify risk and inform regulatory policy and compliance in specific workplace settings, for example, in car mechanics<span class="citation" data-cites="Blake2006">[59]</span> or skilled craftsmen.<span class="citation" data-cites="Williams2007">[60]</span></p>
<h3 id="exposure-reconstruction"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Exposure reconstruction</h3>
<p>Sahmel et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[58]</span> propose a seven-step framework (see Figure ) which they use to enumerate and critique exposure reconstruction approaches.</p>
<p>Reconstruction techniques may be quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative. Quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on data from similar (historic or current) exposure scenarios or simulation studies. Semi-quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on exposure data matrices (using a job-exposure matrix) and/or exposure determinants (using an exposure model). Qualitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on the expert judgement of an industrial hygienist and self reported exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Sahmel2010">[58]</span></p>

<h4 id="job-exposure-matrices"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.1</span> Job-exposure matrices</h4>
<p>Several job-exposure matrices that deal with asbestos have been reported. Pannett et al’s 1985 job-exposure matrix for use in population studies in England and Wales<span class="citation" data-cites="Pannett1985">[61]</span> found good agreement between job-title assigned categories of exposure (none, low, moderate, high) for asbestos and direct review of the original occupational history by an expert.</p>
<p>Rake et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[40]</span> assigned categories risk of exposure (low, medium, high) using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation. This approach has been validated in the same cohort by amphibole fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[50]</span></p>
<p>DOM-JEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2011">[62]</span> was developed for use in population based multi-centre lung cancer case-control study. It assigns job titles one of three categories of asbestos exposure (no exposure, low exposure, high exposure) based on the consensus of three independent expert raters. DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment () but less heterogeneity. In a study applying DOM-JEM to the Netherlands Cohort Study (NCS) DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (K = 0.29).<span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2012">[63]</span></p>
<p>The Finish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)<span class="citation" data-cites="Kauppinen1998">[64]</span> covers exposure to 84 different agents, including asbestos, for 311 jobs across 9 periods spanning 1945-2015. Era-specific estimates of the mean level of asbestos exposure are available for 27 jobs based on expert assessment and measurement data; the exact details of the grounds for estimates are kept in a proprietary FINJEM database which is not freely available. FINJEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure () but reasonable identification of mesothelioma risk when evaluated using the NCS.<span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2012">[63]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Offermans2014">[65]</span></p>
<p>AsbJEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Oyen2015">[66]</span> was developed in Australia by an expert panel of three industrial hygienists using all available exposure data. It is based on FINJEM and provides quantitative estimates of annual exposure for 224 occupations across three time periods spanning 1943 to 2004. It also showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure ()</p>
<p>SYN-JEM<span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2016">[67]</span> describes a JEM developed for four carcinogens. It provides quantified asbestos exposure estimates based on 27958 personal measurements (spanning 1971-2009), a mixed effects statistical model, and a priori categorical assessment of exposure (none, low, high). Cherrie et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[68]</span> point out that SYN-JEM provides little contrast in the modelled exposure level between categories as the geometric mean for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml and that there are wide variations in regional estimates that are difficult to explain.</p>
<p>JEMS are generally taken to be superior to direct questions about exposures because they are cheaper, have greater validity, and are less vulnerable to differential recall. This is because recall of occupations is not influenced by disease status, coding of occupation is blind to case-control status, and translation of codes into exposure is standardized and can not be influence by disease status of a subject.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ahrens1993">[69]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[70]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gramond2012">[71]</span></p>
<p>Orlowski et al<span class="citation" data-cites="Orlowski1993">[72]</span> compared two JEMs with a structured job specific questionnaire (SQ) in a lung cancer case-control study. They found that agreement between the JEMs and the SQ was poor () and suggested that the sources of error for JEMs were loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and the insufficiency of published data on occupational asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>JEMs are not routinely used in clinical practice because they are not usually available or accessible for specific patients. In a research setting they are frequently helpful though in addition to the strengths and weaknesses outlined about the desirability of reusing an existing JEM vs developing a study specific JEM must be considered.</p>
<h4 id="exposure-modelling-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Exposure modelling approaches</h4>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches modify existing measurement data on the basis of knowledge of the determinants of exposure. They may be viewed as the formalization of professional decision criteria used by hygienists in their assessment of workplace exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[57]</span></p>
<p>A common conceptual framework for this is the source-receptor model source receptor model<span class="citation" data-cites="Tielemans2008">[73]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[57]</span> whereby inhalation exposure is considered in terms of an exposure source, a pathway from source to receptor, and the receptor. The model is then used to propose modifying factors such as activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection.<span class="citation" data-cites="Tielemans2008">[73]</span>.</p>
<p>In the hands of some hygienists assessment of historic asbestos exposure based on interview can correlate well with amphibole fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rodelsperger2001">[74]</span> By extension, exposure modelling approaches, using industrial hygienist methods, might be expected to be useful. Exposure modelling approaches make strong intuitive sense; it is known that there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures<span class="citation" data-cites="Symanski2006">[75]</span> and, for example, room size and ventilation have been empirically shown to affect the concentration of airborne chemical exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999a">[76]</span> Further, mathematical exposure models that take account of known exposure modifying factors to estimate past exposures have shown a good correlation with measured values.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie1999">[43]</span></p>
<p>A quantified validated historic asbestos exposure model<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[68]</span> has recently been developed and proposed as a means of for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The approach has the advantage, compared with job-exposure matrices, of providing a more granular quantified exposure assessment, sensitive to the exposure circumstances of the individual. However, the approach is limited by the fact that the individual must recall that they must recall their exposure circumstances which due to the latency of asbestos related disease may have occurred over 30 years ago. The approach is also limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for validation, though is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data.</p>
<p>Exposure modelling approaches to assessing asbestos exposure have research and clinical utility notwithstanding the limitations outlined above together with the requirement that assessors be appropriately trained.</p>
<h4 id="self-reported-exposure"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.3</span> Self-reported exposure</h4>
<p>Self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to. Typically this is elicited by asking about a specific exposure via questionnaire or interview. Differential recall of self-reported exposures according to disease status is a concern but few studies have found evidence of this and it appears to be less of an issue when prompted responses, rather than volunteered, responses about occupational exposures are used.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2000">[77]</span></p>
<p>Most studies comparing self-reported exposures to industrial hygiene measurements have found significant associations but with wide variation in the proportions of variance explained by the self reports. This is not surprising given that it is known there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[70]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Symanski2006">[75]</span></p>
<p>Studies comparing self-reported exposures to expert assessment find highly variable levels of agreement () with a median  . In two studies comparing self-reported exposures with JEMs, self-reported exposures were more sensitive and of similar or worse specificity.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[70]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have been shown to be more accurate for easily sensed exposures such as solvents with a strong smell, dusts with larger particle sizes, and vibrations that can be felt. Providing a reference point, for example using well known machines from a workplace to gauge noise category also improves accuracy.<span class="citation" data-cites="Teschke2002">[70]</span></p>
<p>Self-reported exposures have clinical utility in that they can suggest or support consideration of an occupational cause for disease. Ideally such self-reports are combined with the clinicians knowledge of the likely occupational exposures given the occupational history and other available data to strengthen or weaken the case as appropriate. Similarly, they have utility in a research setting where they may augment other means of assessment.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The accuracy of historic asbestos exposure assessment, by any means, is limited by the paucity of occupational asbestos measurement data, measurement technique limitations, within and between worker exposure variability, and participant recall. There does not exist a universally agreed “gold standard” against which to evaluate methods. Accurate quantified assessment of historic exposure, where evidence is scarce, may be an impossible task.<span class="citation" data-cites="Burstyn2011">[78]</span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, clinically, historic asbestos exposure assessments must be made for attribution. Specifically, to inform whether the required threshold of asbestos exposure (as assessed by various means) has been crossed so it is possible to say that, for example, scarring of the lung with an usual interstital pneumonia pattern in an individual patient is caused by asbestos exposure. This carries medicolegal in addition to scientific importance and has not been well established by any assessment method.</p>
<p>In the context of mesothelioma case-control studies fibre-counts do at least provide an objective means of assessing historic asbestos exposure against which other means can be compared. It is encouraging that industrial hygienist assessment and assessment using job title and PMR correlates strongly with fibre counts.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gramond2012">[71]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Gilham2016">[50]</span> Further and more generally, it is encouraging that estimates from explicit asbestos exposure modelling systems such as Cherrie et al’s<span class="citation" data-cites="Cherrie2018">[68]</span>, show good correlation with measurement data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Quantitative estimates of historic occupational asbestos exposures will generally have high uncertainty. However, less precise measures, such as relative difference in exposure among epidemiological groups may be quite certain even though the numerical estimates are only approximate. This is invaluable in studies examining aetiological hypothesis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1991">[57]</span></p>

<h3 id="mucus-mucins-muc5b-structure-function-and-evolutionary-importance"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Mucus, Mucins, MUC5b: structure, function and evolutionary importance</h3>
<p>Mucus is an essential part of the innate immune system, considered to be universal within most phyla of both aquatic and terrestrial metazoans. It plays a pivotal role in the prevention of disease by serving as an antimicrobial barrier, it also has physiological functions including allowing the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrient and metabolites, lubricating surfaces and reducing damage due to sheer, reducing dehydration of the epithelia and providing the polymeric matrix which enables ciliary-mucus particle transport. Mucus barriers are essential for the separation and protection of an organism from its external environment, and likely a prerequisite for the exclusion of bacteria from bodily tissues and evolution of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The importance of mucus barriers is further underlined when one considers the energy investment continuous mucus production and release requires; for example, corals use mucus to trap particles and transport them towards their mouths and the reef-building coral Acropora acuminata is thought to dedicate up to 40% of its daily net carbon fixation to this task alone.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[79]</span> Mucins are a key component of mucus, they are highly evolutionary conserved large glycoproteins that date back around 600 million years to Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, which is an early marine invertebrate. The earliest human mucin analogue is found in Xenopus tropicalis, the African clawed frog, which evolved about 300 million years ago and mucins are the likely explanation for the observation that frogs show such great resistance to infection during dissection and it has been shown that knockdown of mucin in the skin mucus barrier of Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles leads to susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dubaissi2018">[80]</span></p>
<p>The mucin family is composed of proteins that contain tandom repeat structures with a high proportion of prolines, threonines, and serines; the PTS domain. It is further defined by extensive glycosylation of the PTS domain through N-Acetylgalactosamine O-linkages at the threonine and serine residues.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kufe2009">[81]</span> The resultant oligisaccharide chains and polymeric structure create the viscoeleastic properties of mucus which confer its barrier properties and play an important role in storage and secretion. <span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[79]</span> Mucins are 50-90% carbohydrate and they are anionic because most of their terminal sugars contain carboxyl or sulphate groups. Mucin glycan helps to sequester pathogen by acting as a ‘decoy’ and providing sites for microbial adhesins to bind; for example, human salivary MUC5b interacts with streptococcal species, and patterns of glycosylation change during inflammation.<span class="citation" data-cites="Linden2008">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Linden2008"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[82]</span> Mucin barriers can be subverted by pathogens, strategies include production of enzymes to degrade mucin core proteins and mucin carbohydrates, and evolution of effective motility through mucus gels - many mucosal bacterial pathogens are flagellated for this reason. There is evidence that degradative enzymes are required for pathogenesis in species such as Vibrio cholorae and that flagella are required for infectivity in species such as Helicobacter pylori.<span class="citation" data-cites="Linden2008">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Linden2008"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> Intracellular gel-forming mucins are stored in a compact and condensed form in granules within mucus-secreting cells. They are stored in solution with a high concentration of calcium ions and protons which is thought to be necessary to mask the anionic charge and prevent electrostatic repulsion, upon secretion mucins expand 1000-3000 fold taking up water to form a gel as calcium is exchanged for sodium and the pH rises.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bakshani2018">[79]</span> One consequence of mucins being stored in such a compact form is that when they’re released they can obstruct the airway which in mouse models appears necessary for the clearance of helminth infection<span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[82]</span> and may provide a clue to their evolution.</p>
<p>Normal human airway mucus is a hydrogel composed of approximately 98% water, 0.9% salt, 0.8% globular proteins, and 0.3% high-molecular-weight mucin polymers.<span class="citation" data-cites="Boucher2019">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Boucher2019"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span> Mucin hypersecretion may increase the concentration of solids up to 15% resulting in viscous elastic mucus that is not easily cleared.<span class="citation" data-cites="Fahy2010">[83]</span> 17 genes encode mucins in the human genome of which the gene products of seven are secreted and the remainder are membrane bound. Five of the secreted mucins have terminal cysteine rich domains that can form disulfide bonds resulting in polymers that impart the properties of a gel. MUC5AC and MUC5B, two secreted gel-forming mucins, are strongly expressed in the human respiratory tract. MUC5AC is predominantly expressed in the conducting airways and MUC5B is predominantly expressed in the respiratory airways (muc5b is also expressed in salivary glands, cervix, gallbladder, seminal fluid, and middle ear epithelium). Secreted mucins are large glycoproteins (up to 3x10^6 D per monomer), ranking among the largest molecules encoded in mammalian genomes, and their expression induces and requires an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dickey2017">[84]</span> Mucin production and secretion are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Production is highly regulated at transcriptional level. The ErbB family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its first discovered member. ErbB-receptor signaling appears important for MUC5AC production since inhibition blocks MUC5AC up-regulation by diverse stimuli. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, CD4 cells, Natural killer T cell, Mast cell, Basophil cells, Eosinophil cells and Nuocyte cells. IL-13 is a central regulator in IgE synthesis, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, fibrosis and chitinase up-regulation. It is a mediator of allergic inflammation and different diseases including asthma. IL-13 appears important because it increases MUC5AC expression (IL-1 beta appears to be an important stimulus for MUC5b expression<span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[82]</span>). Basal levels of production and secretion of MUC5AC and MUC5B change as part of an allergic response. The production of MUC5AC can increase 40-200 times as high as normal levels in humans with similar findings in mice, MUC5B increases more modestly, 3 to 10 times in mice. The most important stimulus for secretion appears to be ATP which acts on apical membrane purinergenic (P2Y<sub>2</sub>) receptors. Once secreted mucus gel is propelled in a proximal direction towards the mouth, by ciliary beating as part of the mucociliary escalator, where is expectorated or swallowed. <span class="citation" data-cites="Fahy2010">[83]</span></p>
<h3 id="muc5b-rs3570950-and-respiratory-disease"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> MUC5b rs3570950 and respiratory disease</h3>
<p>Expression and localisation of MUC5AC and MUC5B is different in patients with lung disease compared with health controls. MUC5AC expression is increased in asthma for example, while MUC5B expression is increased in COPD<span class="citation" data-cites="Kesimer2017">[85]</span> and IPF. In COPD MUC5b expression occurs in more proximal airways, whereas in IPF it localised to the bronchiole.<span class="citation" data-cites="Helling2017">[86]</span> MUC5b appears to be particularly important in IPF.</p>
<p>The gain of function promoter variant rs5270590, 3.5 kb upstream of the mucin 5b (MUC5B) transcriptional start site, is the strongest identified risk factor (genetic or otherwise) for the development of either sporadic or familial IPF. The largest study to date (1616 non-hispanic white patients with fibrotic interstitial pneumonias and 4683 controls) estimated that the odds of developing pulmonary fibrosis for those with one copy of the risk allele were 4.5 times (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) the odds of those with no copies and that the odds for those with two copies are 20.2 times those with no copies (95% CI: 15.2–27.0).<span class="citation" data-cites="Fingerlin2013">[87]</span> The strength of association is substantially higher than for most other common risk variants for complex disease with the exception of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region for some autoimmune diseases such as type-1 diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythmatosis which have OR greater than 10. The association between rs35705950 has been replicated in 3 genome wide association studies (GWAS) and a total of 10 independent cohorts including a Mexican cohort and two Asian cohorts and is thought to account for about a third of IPF cases.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[88]</span> However, penetrance is low with up to 20% of non-Hispanic whites having a least one copy of the variant yet IPF occurring only rarely. The rs35705950 variant is a G-to-T transversion that occurs in an area of the MUC5B 5’ flanking region, a region which has characteristics of being an enhancer subject to epigenetic control via DNA methylation and histone modification.<span class="citation" data-cites="Helling2017">[86]</span> An enhancer is a sequence of DNA that functions to enhance transcription. A promoter is a sequence of DNA that initiates the process of transcription. A promoter has to be close to the gene that is being transcribed while an enhancer does not need to be close to the gene of interest. Publicly available data through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) suggest MUC5b promoter site is a complex area of the genome with many transcriptional factors showing evidence of binding.<span class="citation" data-cites="Selman2006">[89]</span> In other words MUC5b expression likely a function of genetic and non-genetic factors.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[88]</span> In addition to IPF, rs35705950 has been found to be positively associated with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis associated interstitial lung disease (AAV-ILD).<span class="citation" data-cites="Namba2019">[90]</span> It has also been found to not be associated with cutaenous systemic sclerois interstital lung disease (SSc-ILD), sarcoidosis, and myositis-ILD. <span class="citation" data-cites="Adegunsoye2019">[91]</span></p>

<p>The rs5270590 variant is associated with a 34 fold increase in expression of MUC5b compared with wild type in healthy control populations and a 5 fold increase in patients with IPF (see figure 1).<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[88]</span> In IPF patients distal airway MUC5b is expressed preferentially, compared with MUC5Ac. MUC5b also expressed in honeycomb cysts, a defining characteristic of the usual interstitial pneumonia CT pattern typically seen in IPF.<span class="citation" data-cites="Seibold2013">[92]</span></p>

</figure>
<p>Proposed mechanisms for the role of the rs5270590 variant in the pathogenesis of IPF include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>excessive production of MUC5B by stem cells that attempt to regenerate injured bronchiolar and alvelar epithelium could disrupt normal development pathways and highjack normal reparative mechanisms of the distal lung resulting in fibroprolferation and honeycomb cyst formation.</li>
<li>excessive MUC5B production leads to reduced mucociliary function, retention of particles, and enhanced lung injury.</li>
<li>interaction between MUC5b and motile cilia since distinct cilium gene expression in IPF lung has been observed.</li>
<li>excessive MUC5b production inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response.<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[88]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Muc5b has been studied in mice. A Mub5b knockout mouse study found that muc5b is essential for mucociliary clearance, for controlling airway and middle ear infections, and maintaining immune homeostasis in the lungs. Knockout mice had airflow limitation and died from infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus.<span class="citation" data-cites="Roy2014">[93]</span> A transgenic muc5b mouse model of muc5b overexpression found that overexpression causes mucociliary dysfuction and enhances lung fibrosis on response to bleomycin.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hancock2018">[94]</span> Intriguingly, in recent bleomycin lung fibrosis model studies lung fibrosis was attenuated and mortality reduced in both germ-free mice and IL-17B deficient mice supporting the concept that fibrosis in response to epithelial injury is mediated by interaction of the immune system with microbiota.<span class="citation" data-cites="ODwyer2019">[95]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2019">[96]</span></p>
<h3 id="infectionimmunity"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> infection/immunity</h3>
<p>The frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10% in European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950) but is less than 1% in African and East Asian populations. Clearly the rs35705950 variant is not subject to negative selection due to IPF risk since onset is well after the reproductive age begins<span class="citation" data-cites="Evans2016">[88]</span>; the variation in frequency observed is consistent with strong positive selection. The increased MUC5b expression in the airways associated with the rs35705950 variant may have conferred a survival advantage by providing protection against lung infection. <span class="citation" data-cites="Dickey2017">[84]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Jaramillo2018">[82]</span> A relation between the rs35705950 variant, disease risk, and infection is also supported by the observation that in a prospective study of 65 IPF patients have higher bacterial loads than COPD and healthy controls and within IPF patients those with homozygous (TT) for variant had significantly lower bacterial loads (P=0.01), measured by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction of bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Within IPF those with higher bacterial loads were also at increased risk of death.<span class="citation" data-cites="Molyneaux2014">[97]</span> These finding are consistent with observation that the rs35705950 variant is associated with improved survival in IPF<span class="citation" data-cites="Peljto2013">[98]</span> and fewer acute respiratory disease events in the COPDGene cohort with interstitial features.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ash2018">[99]</span> However, these studies are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis if not properly accounted for.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dudbridge2019">[100]</span> For example, it is known that the rs35705950 variant is associated with interstitial lung abnormalities<span class="citation" data-cites="Hunninghake2013">[101]</span>, since the diagnosis of IPF relies heavily on radiological appearances individuals with the variant might tend to be diagnosed earlier in the course of their disease giving the false impression, when comparing them to IPF patients without the disease variant that is associated with survival. Further support for the importance of infection in IPF provided by the observation that immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon gamma, ethanercept, prednisolone, azathioprine and N-acetylcysteine have failed to prolong survival in IPF<span class="citation" data-cites="WarheitNiemi2019">[102]</span> to prolong survival in IPF, from a small (N = 181) double blinded randomized controlled study which found reduced symptom burden and improved survival associated with cotrimoxazole<span class="citation" data-cites="Shulgina2013">[103]</span>, as well as evidence from genetic and animal studies. IPF GWAS have identified single nucleotide variants associated with disease susceptibility in the Toll interacting protein (TOLLIP) gene, for example rs111521887. TOLLIP is an inhibitory adaptor protein within Toll-like receptors (TLR) and part of the innate immune system recognising pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)<span class="citation" data-cites="Noth2013">[104]</span> and, intriguingly, in a mouse bleomycin lung fibrosis model the absence of a microbiome protected against mortality.<span class="citation" data-cites="ODwyer2019">[95]</span></p>

<p>While the frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10% in European populations(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950), its penetrance is low. The median prevalence of IPF for men and women in Europe is approximately 3.75 per 100000 for the period 2001-2013<span class="citation" data-cites="Marshall2018">[105]</span>, other genetic and/or environmental factors must be at play. In addition to responding to PAMPs as outlined above the innate immune system also responds to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which can result from inhalation of inorganic respirable toxins such as silica or asbestos.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dostert2008">[106]</span> Secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta (which is also a stimulus for MUC5b expression) is elevated in alveolar macrophages of patients with ILD, including IPF, sarcoidosis, silicosis, RA-ILD, and asbestosis.<span class="citation" data-cites="Byrne2016">[107]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Howrylak2017">[108]</span> Inflammasome are multiprotein intracellular complexes that detect pathogenic microorganisms (PAMPs) and sterile stressors (DAMPs).

<p>The apparently complex interplay between exposure to organic and inorganic respiratory toxins, the mucus barrier, respiratory epithelium and resident cells such as alveolar macrophages in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely characterised but genetic, epigenetic, gene-expression, and epidemiological studies are beginning to fill in the gaps. Gene-environment interaction between the rs5270590 variant and occupational inorganic respiratory toxins such as asbestos may modulate IPF risk and help to explain the incomplete penetrance observed. Studies to date which have selected patients on the basis of a diagnosis of IPF and then stratified by MUC5b genotype are at risk of index-event bias. A large case-control study of IPF which captures details of occupational exposures, genotype, and potential confounders, whilst also measuring factors likely to affect disease pickup such as disease severity and radiographic changes is required.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>My study will be a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study. Participants will be recruited from a UK network of six confirmed centres. Cases will be men who present, between 07.2017 and 07.2019, with a new diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria<span class="citation" data-cites="Raghu2011">[111]</span>; they will be identified monthly by the MDT coordinator of participating centres.<span class="citation" data-cites="NICE2013">[112]</span></p>
<p>For each case, four controls, frequency-matched on age, will be randomly selected from incident outpatient attendances (not confined to respiratory) who do not have a diagnosis of IPF and are from the hospital as the case. Monthly lists of outpatient attendances will be obtained using the patient administration systems of participating centres. 120 cases and 480 controls will be recruited over two years with four participants enrolled and interviewed per day.</p>
<p>Eligible participants will be contacted by telephone and invited to participate. An interviewer will collect data on demographics, lifetime occupational history, hobbies, family medical history, and smoking using a structured web-based questionnaire designed by us to collect lifetime occupational histories. This approach will facilitate coding, allow input validation, and permit questions to be tailored to pre-specified conditions. The questions will be developed in collaboration with an international expert in asbestos exposure measurement, Dr John Cherrie of the IOM. Participants will be invited to provide a venous blood sample for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>Cases and controls will be genotyped using a panel of 15 pre-defined candidate susceptibility SNPs including rs35705950. Genotyping will be undertaken using Q-PCR and Taqman assays on DNA isolated from whole blood samples.</p>
<p>For the primary analysis unconditional logistic regression will be used to analyse ‘any’ vs ‘no’ asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. Prior data<span class="citation" data-cites="Rake2009">[40]</span> indicate that the probability of exposure among controls is 0.29.
