## Occupational asbestos exposure as an underecognised cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2012 was the recorded cause of death for c.4000 people in England and Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5\% pa since 2000.[@Navaratnam2011] The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).[@Maher2012][@Ley2013][@Spagnolo2014] The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas[@Navaratnam2011], patterns that are not unique to the UK.[@Ley2013] The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.[@Hubbard1998][@Vancheri2010] 

These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.[@Barber2015] Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with 'IPF' and revision of the diagnosis to 'asbestosis'.[@Monso1990][@Monso1991][@Glazer2009][@Ghio2014] 

Identification of occupational asbestos fibre exposure as an under-recognised cause of IPF is important to improve our understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.

## Aims and objectives 

My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950). 

My specific research questions are:
1. Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF? 
2. Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950? 

## Approach

Finding a causal relationship between occupational asbestos exposure and IPF requires overcoming both difficulties which are general to establishing a causal relationship in the world and difficulties which are specific the case of occupational asbestos exposure and IPF.

General difficulties are captured by bradford-hill criteria (expand and acknowledge roth multicausality and level of proof we're going for, draw on chap 25 and slides on possible ways of answering the q). 

Specifcic difficulties: long latency (recall, recall bias)

INTRODUCTION
Attributing a disease process to a specific exposure can
be difficult. Establishing causation is often complex,
all the more so given the multifactorial nature of many
chronic conditions. Well-studied and relatively frequent
entities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
ischaemic heart disease and diabetes lend themselves to
epidemiologic investigation, delineating the major risk
factors for disease and their relative contributions to
risk at the population level. Uncommon diseases pres-
ent added challenges to attribution, especially those for
which the underlying pathological processes are poorly
elucidated and the condition is typically considered
idiopathic.
Due to their infrequency, uncommon pro-
cesses are difficult to study using standard epidemio-
logic techniques, even using case-referent approaches.
Only infrequently are potential associations for such
diseases amenable to assessments that conform to
Bradfordâ€“Hill criteria or other rigorous standards of
causation. In particular, the links between occupational
factors and uncommon respiratory conditions are often
first described in isolated case reports or limited case
series. These accounts, even with their acknowledged
limitations, serve to document the potential association
between a disease and an exposure scenario and dissem-
inate that information to a wider clinical and academic
community.
As additional case reports appear with a similar occu-
pational association, the initial suspicion of cause and
effect can be strengthened, although this may be coun-
terbalanced by a publication bias against the appear-
ance of further, similar case reports due to a perceived
lack of novelty in similar reports. Systematic literature
reviews of multiple cases or case series and, where fea-
sible, case-referent investigations can serve to further
support the validity of perceived causality. Animal data
can also be critical, presuming that an experimental
model exists for the disease process in question

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diagnosis of
exclusion. It is made in the presence on high-resolution
CT scan of a pattern consistent with usual interstitial
pneumonitis (UIP) or its confirmation by biopsy. The
diagnosis requires that known causes of interstitial lung
disease (such as drug toxicity, connective tissue disease
and domestic and occupational or environmental expo-
sures) be excluded (Travis et al., 2013).
In practice, a known cause of fibrosis that would
exclude IPF may be missed. For example, Monso et al.
(1991) studied the lung dust content in IPF with scan-
ning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray
analysis in 25 patients with a previous pathological diag-
nosis of IPF (using optical microscopy) and 25 normal
lung controls. They identified a significant asbestos fibre
burden in two of the cases (8%), leading to an alterna-
tive diagnosis of asbestosis. It is known that a variety of
exposures can be associated with a UIP pathological pat-
tern of response, including asbestos. Notably, extrinsic

alveolitis, which can be occupational or environmental,
is also prone to misdiagnosis as IPF (Morell et al., 2013;
Kern et al., 2015). Extrinsic alveolitis is covered exten-
sively elsewhere in this text and will not be considered
further here.

## Data sources 

- For the literature review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures in IPF I consider all published IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures. 
- For the mortality analysis I use data obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Health and Safety Executive, and the World Health Organisation Mortality Database.
- Brief reviews of asbestos exposure assessment and genetic suceptibility in IPF rely on the published literature.
- Primary case-control data collected during my PhD as part of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) is used to analyze asbestos exposure in IPF. (?include navaratum case control jobs data that was shared)

## Outline of thesis

This chapter (Chapter 1) describes the problem studied, aims and objectives, and approach. Chapter 2 is a literature review and meta-analysis of IPF case-control studies that report on occupational exposure. Chapter 3 is an analysis of IPF and asbestos related disease mortality data. Chapter 4 is a review of asbestos exposure assessment methodology. Chapter 5 is a review of genetic suceptibility in IPF. Chapter 6 describes the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study including
results and analysis arising from it. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by summarising it and suggesting future work.
