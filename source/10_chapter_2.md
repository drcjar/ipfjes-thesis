# Literature review and meta-analysis: how much IPF is attributable to occupational exposures?

## Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is made in the presence of a usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern on high resolution CT scan or biopsy. The diagnosis requires that known causes of interstitial lung disease (such as drug toxicity, connective tissue disease, domestic, and occupational or environmental exposures) be excluded.[@Travis2013]

Attributing a disease process to a specific exposure can be difficult. Disease processes are frequently complex or multifactorial, depending on the interaction of genetic and environmental components. Well-studied and relatively frequent entities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes lend themselves to epidemiologic investigation, delineating the major risk factors for disease and their relative contributions to
risk at the population level. IPF presents an additional challenge to attribution; because of its relative infrequency, epidemiologic study of the disease is largely limited to case-control studies.[@Reynolds2017] Studying specific occupational exposures also presents its own challenges; co-exposure is common, occupational hygiene data are frequently limited and self-reported exposure is prone to recall bias.

I identified several review articles of the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease that do not necessarily focus on IPF and only briefly mention occupational factors (e.g Ley2013[@Ley2013]). Here I consider review articles that specifically deal with occupational factors in IPF and cite the case-control studies used.

Turner-Warwick (1998) discusses potential difficulties in establishing attribution and causality in IPF. She observes that there is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied to exclude IPF; some clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential cause is identified, others only when there is clear exposure to an established cause. She explains that diagnosis based on radiologic and clinical findings, and not on lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage, may result in initiating agents for disease being overlooked. Further, that exposures to agents such as asbestos, silica, coal, graphite, hard metal, and avian proteins, may result in disease that can not be differentiated from IPF.[@Turner-Warwick1998]

Reviewing the epidemiology of IPF and case-control studies to date, Hubbard (2001) describes the association of IPF with occupational exposures to metal and wood and estimates that 10\% of IPF cases may be due to occupational metal exposure and 5\% of cases to wood.[@Hubbard2001]

Taskar and Coultas (2006) review and carry out a meta-analysis of six case-control studies investigating environmental and occupational exposures in IPF. They report population attributable risk percentages for agriculture and farming (20.8\%), livestock (4.1\%), wood dust (5\%), metal dust (3.4\%), stone/sand/silica (3.5\%), and smoking (49.1\%).[@Taskar2006]

Gulati and Redlich’s (2015) review of exposures causing UIP highlights that asbestosis may appear indistinguishable from IPF and summarises previous case-control studies but did not pool studies to perform a meta-analysis.[@Gulati2015]

I sought to identify and meta-analyze all IPF case-control studies dealing with occupational exposures. This work contributed to a joint ERS-ATS taskforce on the occupational burden of non-malignant respiratory disease.[@Blanc2019]

## Method

I searched Pubmed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases for combinations of the terms 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'occupation', 'case-control study' and synonyms. My search included all publications published from the respective database start dates until September 2018. When I identified a relevant paper I also reviewed the references and papers citing the paper. I also used Medline ranker[@Fontaine2009] and bespoke Pubmed 'mining' techniques that I developed.[@Reynolds2017pubmed]

A colleague independently reviewed and abstracted data for five exposure categories common to the identified case-control studies: “vapors, gases, dusts, and/or fumes (VGDF)”, “metal dust”, “wood dust”, “silica dust”, and “agricultural dust”. I calculated population attributable fraction (PAF) as follows: PAF\ensuremath{=}pc(OR - 1)/OR, where pc is the proportion of cases exposed and OR is the risk estimate.  

I tabulated study control and case definitions and exposure measures and assessed the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool.[@Pega2020] 

I calculated pooled OR and pooled PAF for occupational exposures using a random effects model in Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). I selected a random effects, rather than fixed effects, model because there were significant differences in study design and populations between studies. The pooled PAF relied on the ratio of attributable cases to all cases underlying each risk estimate.

## Results 

I found (as of September 2018) one cohort and 14 case-control studies looking at occupational exposures in IPF; the most recent review article[@Gulati2015] covers only eight of them. Associations with metal, wood, silica, and agricultural dust were reported. [@Scott1990] [@Iwai1994] [@Hubbard1996a] [@Mullen1998] [@Baumgartner2000] [@Hubbard2000] [@Miyake2005] [@Gustafson2007] [@Pinheiro2008] [@Garcia-SanchoFigueroa2010] [@Garcia-Sancho2011] [@Awadalla2012] [@Paolocci2013] [@Ekstrom2014] [@Koo2017] One study[@Paolocci2013] was included even though it was only available as an abstract at the time of analysis because I knew the full text paper was forthcoming.[@Paolocci2018] Figures 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are adapted from Blanc et al 2019.[@Blanc2019] 

![Previous IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures. (Blanc 2019)](source/figures/prevstudies.jpg)

There was considerable heterogeneity in case-control studies of occupational exposure in IPF, for example, I^2^ \ensuremath{=} 95% for the six studies reporting general (vapors, gas, dust and fume) occupational respiratory exposures[@Blanc2019] and to a lesser extent for wood, metal and stone dust. See Figures 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. This may be due to real clinical differences in the populations studied or due to chance, publication bias, or methodological issues. To investigate possible publication bias I looked for funnel plot asymmetry using data from the ERS/ATS taskforce meta-analysis[@Blanc2019]. I found evidence of publication bias for VGDF, and metal dust (Egger's test p \ensuremath{=} 0.04) but not for wood dust  (Egger's test p \ensuremath{=} 0.1) and not for agricultural dust (Egger's test p \ensuremath{=} 0.58). 

Considering the possibility of methodological issues I tabulated study case and control definitions and exposure measures and assessed the risk of bias using RoB-SPEO[@Pega2020], a tool for assessing risk of bias in studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to occupational risk factors. Seven[@Scott1990][@Hubbard1996][@Baumgartner2000][@Gustafson2007][@Garcia-Sancho2011][@Paolocci2013][@Koo2017] of the twelve case-control studies considered in the meta-analysis used population controls. One study[@Hubbard2000] used a pension fund record to select cases and controls, one study used an orthopaedic practice list[@Mullen1998], and three studies used respiratory inpatients or a mix of respiratory inpatients and outpatients[@Miyake2005][@Awadalla2012][@Koo2017] Two studies did not match on age or sex[@Paolocci2013][@Miyake2005] and one study matched on age only.[@Gustafson2007] 

Where participation rates were reported for community controls they were generally low, for example one study which mailed a questionnaire to potential participants had a response rate of 32.4% for controls.[@Mullen1998] In another study using a mailed questionnaire 60% of controls returned a completed questionnaire.[@Scott1990] One study was a cohort study that made use of a company's pension fund records and was only able to locate occupational records for 40% of cases and 38% of controls.[@Hubbard2000] 

Seven of the studies used only a questionnaire alone to measure occupational exposures.[@Scott1990][@Mullen1998][@Miyake2005][@Gustafson2007][@Awadalla2012][@Paolocci2013] Questionnaires reportedly asked directly about exposures of the format ‘‘In your work, have you ever been exposed to y?’’[@Gustafson2007] but are unfortunately unpublished. Two studies reported blinding of assessors.[@Baumgartner2000][@Koo2017] None of the studies were pre-registered. 

Application of the Rob-SPEO tool[@Pega2020] revealed that in general studies of occupational exposure in IPF to date are at high risk of selection bias due to low participation rates, recruitment from sources likely to be associated with exposures under study e.g respiratory inpatients, and lack of matching. The majority of studies also had a high risk of bias from exposure misclassification and/or incomplete exposure data through reliance on questionnaires that used yes/no questions for a limited number of specific exposures, bias due to lack of blinding, and possible bias due to differential reporting of exposures given that none of the studies appear to be pre-registered. See Tables 2.1 and 2.2.

I used 40 risk estimates from 12 publications (1326 IPF cases in total) to perform a meta-analysis.[@Scott1990] [@Hubbard1996a] [@Mullen1998] [@Baumgartner2000] [@Hubbard2000] [@Miyake2005] [@Gustafson2007] [@Garcia-SanchoFigueroa2010] [@Garcia-Sancho2011] [@Awadalla2012] [@Paolocci2013] [@Koo2017] Three studies were not used, one because data was not collected on the proportion of cases with specific occupational exposures[@Iwai1994], one because of methodological differences in exposure assignment[@Pinheiro2008], and one because it reported data for pulmonary fibrosis rather than IPF.[@Ekstrom2014] Each exposure category was assessed with 5-11 risk estimates (Table 2.2).

## Discussion 

My results support the case for a proportion of IPF cases being attributable to occupational exposures. Pooled ORs were significantly elevated for VGDF, metal dust, wood dust, agricultural dust, and silica dust; the pooled PAF estimates by category ranged from 4-23\%. This is an important finding for an otherwise idiopathic disease which carries significant morbidity and mortality; identifying causal occupational agents could permit remediation and prevention.  

Associations between IPF and wood, metal, and agricultural dust were previously reported in a meta-analysis of six case-control studies by Taskar and Coultas.[@Taskar2006] While my findings are similar I found a smaller effect size for agricultural exposure and a large effect size for non-specific vapors, gases, dust, and fumes (VGDF), see Table 2.2.  

Funnel plot asymmetry using Egger's test, which may be due to publication bias, was present for VGDF (p \ensuremath{=} 0.04) and metal dust (p \ensuremath{=} 0.03) but not for wood dust (p \ensuremath{=} 0.09), silica dust (p \ensuremath{=} 0.2), and agricultural dust (p \ensuremath{=} 0.6). However, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of this since tests of funnel plot asymmetry are underpowered to distinguish chance from real asymmetry when fewer than 10 studies are being considered.[@Deeks2019] 

There are several limitations to the meta-analysis that arise from the studies included. Collectively application of the Rob-SPEO tool[@Pega2020] showed that these studies were at high risk for bias arising from selection, lack of blinding, exposure misclassification, incomplete exposure data, and selective reporting of exposures. Case definitions and sources for cases varied between studies. For example Scott (1990)[@Scott1990] used a case definition which included a chest radiograph showing bilateral interstitial shadowing whereas most other studies relied on high resolution CT. Four studies used mortality data [@Iwai1994][@Pinheiro2008][@Gustafson2007][@Hubbard2000] to identify cases and one study[@Gustafson2007] used a national register of patients receiving oxygen therapy. Differences in healthcare coverage and coding practices can result in selection bias in studies making use of mortality data.[@Caminati2015] Nearly all of the studies relied on self-reported exposures rather than life time occupational histories to assess exposure; an approach that is prone to recall bias, does not permit examination of dose-response relationships, and is vulnerable to confounding as a result of co-exposure. For example, several studies have described strong associations between metal work and IPF and specify sheet metal workers[@Iwai1994][@Scott1990][@Hubbard2000], a group who are frequently exposed to dust containing asbestos fibres[@Welch1994] and who in a recent UK study, had the highest risk of mesothelioma.[@Rake2009] Seven of the IPF case-control studies considered in the meta-analysis did report on occupational asbestos exposure but found no significant association.[@Scott1990][@Hubbard1996][@Mullen1998][@Baumgartner2000][@Miyake2005][@Gustafson2007][@Koo2017] This may be due to the studies considered being underpowered, not having used sufficiently sensitive asbestos exposure measures, and the methodological shortcomings of study design outlined above.

## Conclusion

The observed excess risk could represent disease misclassification of pneumoconiosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but this is unlikely to fully explain the observed effects. My analysis supports an aetiologic role for occupational exposures in IPF, potentially explaining up to 23\% of the burden of disease and highlighting a role for workplace exposure reduction in disease prevention.

Confidence in the meta-analysis results is tempered by the observation that collectively studies investigating occupational exposures were at high risk for bias arising from selection, lack of blinding, exposure misclassification, incomplete exposure data, and selective reporting of exposures.
