## Occupational asbestos exposure as an underecognised cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2012 was the recorded cause of death for c.4000 people in England/Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5\% pa since 2000.[@Navaratnam2011] The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).[@Maher2012][@Ley2013][@Spagnolo2014] The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas[@Navaratnam2011], patterns that are not unique to the UK.[@Ley2013] The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.[@Hubbard1998][@Vancheri2010] 

These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.[@Barber2015] Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with 'IPF' and revision of the diagnosis to 'asbestosis'.[@Monso1990][@Monso1991][@Glazer2009][@Ghio2014] 

Identification of occupational asbestos fibre exposure as an under-recognised cause of IPF is important to improve our understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.

## Aims and objectives

My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950). 

My specific research questions are:
1. Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF? 
2. Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950?
