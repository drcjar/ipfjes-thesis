## Occupational asbestos exposure as an under-recognised cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease which in 2016 was the recorded cause of death for approximately 5000 people in England and Wales. Its incidence, currently around 7.5/100,000 person-years, has increased by 5\% per annum in the period 1979-2016.[@Navaratnam2011][@Navaratnam2019] The pathophysiology of IPF is complex, the outcome of host susceptibility factors, epithelial injury, and a dysregulated repair process. Several gene polymorphisms which result in a
vulnerable alveolar epithelium have been characterized; they include abnormalities in mucin genes (eg MUC5B), surfactant protein genes, and telomerase genes (eg TERT and TERC).[@Maher2012][@Ley2013][@Spagnolo2014] The median age of onset is 70 years and the condition is more common in men (M:F ratio 1.6), manual workers, and those living in industrial areas[@Navaratnam2011], patterns that are not unique to the UK.[@Ley2013][@Hutchinson2014] The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three years.[@Hubbard1998][@Vancheri2010] 

These epidemiological distributions of IPF are consistent with a long-latency response to occupational dust exposure; in particular, the incidence of IPF correlates strongly (if ecologically) with historic asbestos use.[@Barber2015] Clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings in asbestosis and IPF are similar[@Corrin1985][@Copley2003]. Mineralogical studies support the concept of asbestosis-IPF misclassification by revealing high fibre burdens in the lung tissue of patients diagnosed with 'IPF' and revision of the diagnosis to 'asbestosis'.[@Monso1990][@Monso1991][@Glazer2009][@Ghio2014] 

Establishing if occupational asbestos fibre exposure is an under-recognised cause of IPF is an important step towards understanding of the aetio-pathophysiology of IPF and the accuracy of prognostic information. It would have implications for compensation and might impact on the current restrictions on individual treatment. Importantly, it would provide an additional data source to inform evidence-based workplace exposure policies in the UK and internationally, particularly in the many countries with continuing high levels of asbestos use.

## Aims and objectives 

My overall aim is to characterize and measure asbestos exposure as an occupational determinant of IPF; additionally, I will determine host-exposure interactions mediated by candidate susceptibility polymorphisms (in particular MUC5B promoter polymorphism rs35705950). 

My specific research questions are:

1. Is there an association between occupational asbestos exposure and IPF? 
2. Does a dose-response relationship exist for occupational asbestos exposure and IPF? 
3. Does the presence of asbestos exposure modify the association between IPF and rs35705950? 

## Data sources 

- For the literature review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures in IPF I consider all published IPF case-control studies reporting on occupational exposures. 
- For the mortality analysis I use data obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Health and Safety Executive, and the World Health Organisation Mortality Database.
- For brief reviews of asbestos exposure assessment and genetic susceptibility in IPF I rely on the published literature.
- Primary case-control data collected during my PhD as part of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) is used to analyze asbestos exposure in IPF. 

## Outline of thesis

This chapter (Chapter 1) describes the problem studied, aims, objectives, and approach. Chapter 2 is a literature review and meta-analysis of IPF case-control studies that report on occupational exposures. Chapter 3 is an analysis of IPF and asbestos related disease mortality data. Chapter 4 is a review of asbestos exposure assessment methodology. Chapter 5 is a review of the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 in IPF. Chapter 6 describes the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES) including results and analysis arising from it. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by summarising it and suggesting future work.
