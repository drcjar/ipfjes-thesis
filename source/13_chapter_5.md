## Introduction

Advances in our understanding of IPF susceptibility now permit study of host-exposure interactions. The minor-allele of the rs35705950 SNP in the promotor region of the mucin 5B gene was found to be present in 38\% of IPF patients but just 9\% of controls.[@Seibold2011] The polymorphism results in excess MUC5B protein in the airway, impaired clearance of inhaled substances and a chronic inflammatory burden on the alveolar surface.[@Seibold2011] The association is allele dose-dependent, has been replicated in independent cohorts, and may affect survival (in what direction is contested).[@Ley2013][@Seibold2011][@Peljto2013][@Dudbridge2019] Two large GWASs have confirmed the observed associations of IPF with MUC5B and other loci.[@Fingerlin2013][@Noth2013]


## Method

We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of "asbestos", "exposure assessment", together with terms for modes of assessment including "lung biopsy", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "exposure reconstruction", and "job-exposure matrix". When a relevant papers was identified, papers referenced, and papers citing, the paper were reviewed.
