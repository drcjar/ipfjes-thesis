## Introduction

### Mucins, MUC5b structure, function, and evolutionary importance

The mucin family includes proteins that contain tandom repeat structures with a high proportion of prolines, threonines, and serines (which constitute the PTS domain). They are futer defined by extensive glycosylation of the PTS domain through N-Acetylgalactosamine O-linkages at the threonine and serine residues.[@Kufe2009] 

Mucins are highly evolutionary conserved large glycoproteins that date back around 600 million years to Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, which is an early marine invertebrate. They are a key component of mucus barriers, essential for the separation and protection of an organism from its external environment, and likely a prerequisite for the evolution of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.  

The earliest human mucin analgoue is found in Xenopus tropicalis, the African clawed frog, which evolved about 300 million years ago. Mucins are the likely explanation for the observation that frogs show such great resistance to infection during disection and it has been shown that without mucins xenopus get infections.[@Dubaissi2018] 

Mucus is an essential part of the innate immune system, considered to be universal within most phyla of both aquatic and teresterial meazoans. It plays a piviotal role in the prevention of disease by serving as an antimicrobial barier, it also has physiological function including allowing hte exchange of oxygen, carbon diaoxide, nutiresnt and metabolits , whilst lubricating surfaces and reducing ddamage due to sheeer and reducing deydration ofd the epoitheliia, and providing hte polymeric matrix which enables ciliary-mucus particle transport.[@Bakshani2018]

evolution of effective barrier properties in a functional surface mucosa appears assosiated with general exclusion of bacteria from bodily tissues. [@Bakshani2018] 

oligisaccharide chains and polymeric strucutre anre thought to confer viscoeleastic properties of mucus which confer its barrier properties. also play crucial role in storage and secreation; intracellular gel-forming mucins are stored in a compact and condensed form in granules within mucus-serceting cells. they're anionic and in stored form high concentration of calcium ions and protons is thought to mask charge and prevent electrostatic repulsion. upon secreation mucins expand 1000-3000 fold taking up water to form a gel as calciu is exchanged for sodium and the pH rises.[@Bakshani2018]


Normal mucus is 97\% water and 3\%solids (mucins, non-mucins, salts, lipids, and cellular debris). Mucin hypersecreation may increase the concentration of solids up to 15\% resulting in viscous elastic mucus that is not easily cleared.
[@Fahy2010]

Secreted mucins are among the largest molecules encoded in mammalian genomes, their expression induces and requires an endoplasmic reticulum stress response[@Dickey2017] they are glycoproteins (up to 3x10^6 D per monomer) with a regions rich in serine and threonine residues linked by their hydroxyl side groups to sugar chains (O-glycosylation). They account for less than 30\% of the solids in mucus.

Mucins are 50-90% carbohydrate and they are anionic because most of their terminal sugars contain carboxyl or sulphate groups.

Mucin glycan help sequested pathogens by providing sites for microbes to bind and patterns of glycosolation change during inflammation. 

17 genes encoding mucins in the human genome of which the gene products of seven are secreted and the remainder are membrane bound.

Five of the secreted mucins have terminal cysteine rich domains that can form disulfide bonds resulting in polymers that impart the properties of a gel. MUC5AC and MUC5B are strongly expressed in the airmwars and detected in similar quantities in human mucus.

MUC5AC is predominantly expressed in the conducting airways and MUC5B is predominantly expressed in the respiratory airways.

Basal levels of secreation of MUC5AC and MUC5B change as part of an allergic response. The production of MUC5AC can increase 40-200 times as high as normal levels in humans with similar findings in mice, MUC5B increases more modestly, 3 to 10 times in mice.

Production is highly regulated at transriptional level. The ErbB family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its first discovered member. ErbB-receptor signaling appears important since inhibtion blocks MUC5AC up-regulation by diverse stimuli.  IL-13 is a cytokine secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, CD4 cells, Natural killer T cell, Mast cell, Basophil cells, Eosinophil cells and Nuocyte
cells. Interleukin-13 is a central regulator in IgE synthesis, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, fibrosis and chitinase up-regulation. It is a mediator of allergic inflammation and different diseases including asthma. IL-13 seems important because it increases MUC5AC expression. (IL-1\beta seems important for muc5b [@Jaramillo2018])

Mucin screation is regulated separetly from production. The most important stimulus for secretion appears to be ATP which acts on apical membrane purinergenic (P2Y~2~) receptors 

Mucins are stored in a dehydrated compact form so when they're released they can obstruct the airway; this may be necessary for clearance of helminth infection.

mucus gel is propelled in a proximal direction by ciliary beating as part of the mucociliary escalator.

### MUC5b rs3570950 and respiratory disease

#### Evoltionary medcicine


#### Potential role in IPF pathogenesis


rs35705950 associated with ILA, IPF, CHP, and RA-ILD.
not associated with SSc-ILD, sarcoidosis, myositis-ILD
[@Adegunsoye2019]

one study looked at muc5b promotor and risk of coal workers pneumoconiosis rs2672794 and found a non-significant association[@Ji2014]

In the distal airway MUC5b is expressed preferentially, compared with MUC5Ac [@Seibold2013],
Honeycomb cysts are a defining characteristic of the usual interstitial pneumonia CT pattern typically seen in IPF. MUC5b is the dominant gel-forming mucin in honeycomb cysts[@Seibold2013]  


excessive MUC5b production in small airway may lead to impaired cilia-mediated clearance leading to chronic airwayy infection and inflamation, bronchiectassis, and distal lung remodelling[@Evans2016]

possible mechanisms of pathogenesis include 1. excessive production of MUC5B by stem cells that attempt to regenerate injured bronchiolar and alvelar epithelium could disrupt normal development pathways and highjack normal repartive mechanisms of the distl jung resulting in fibroprolferation oand honeycomb cyst formation 2. excessive MUC5B production leads to reduced mucocilary function,
retention of particles, and enhanced lung injury. 3. interaction between MUC5b and motile cilia since distinct cilium gene expression in ipf lung has been observed. 4. excessive MUC5b production may induce endoplasmic retiulum stress and unfolded protein response.[@Evans2016]


knockout and overexpression models of muc5ac and muc5b in mice:
Excessive mucus production is the hallmark of chronic bronchitis and associated with reduced lung fuction. Deletion of Muc5b results in impaired mucociliary clearance and airway infections in mice. Deleting Muc5ac resulted in reduced aireway reactivity whereas overexpression Muc5ac provided protection against viral infection.

muc5b overexpression causes mucociliary dysfunction and enhances lung fibrosis in response to bleomycin in a transgenic mouse model, authors hypothesise that aetiology of IPF will be best understood by identifying genes, transcropts, and environmental exposures that intereact with MUC5B and contribute to development of IPF.[@Hancock2018]

Understanding how expression of mucins and other genes are spatially regulated within the normal airway epithelium and how genetic and environmental factors that affect gene regulation affect disease risks remains a major challenge.
[@Bonser2019]


muc5b is found in the respiratory tract, salivary glands, cervix, gallbladder, seminal fluid, and middle ear epithelium.

mucins as decoys for microbial adhesins, for example salivary muc5b interacts with streptococcal species 

mucin barrier can be subverted by pathogens, strategies include production of enzymes to degrade mucin core proteins and mucin carbohydrates and effective motility through mucus gels. many mucosal bacterial pahtogens are flagellated for this reason. is evidence that degradative enzymes required for pathogeneisis e.g vibrio cholorae and flagella required e.g h.pylori with dysfunctional flagella has greatly reduced ability to infect. 

[@Linden2008]



Gain of function promotor variant rs5270590, 3.5 kb upstream of the mucin 5b (MUC5B) transcriptional start site, is the strongest identified risk factor (genetic or otherwise) for the develiopment of either sporadic or familial IPF. The association between rs35705950 has been replicated in 3 gwas and a total of 10 indeopendant cohorts including a mexican cohort and two asian cohorts. However, penetrace is low iwth up to 20\% of non-hispanic whites having a least one copy of the
variant yet IPF occuring only rarely.

rs35705950 variant is a G-to-T transversion that occuris in an area of the MUC5B 5' flanking region which has characteristics of being an enhancer regioni subject to epigentic control via dna methylation and histone modification.[@Helling2017] 

rs35705950 key role in aetiology of IPF accountinf for about a third of indiuccudlas who devleop the disease[@Evans2016]
An enhancer is a sequence of DNA that functions to enhance transcription. A promoter is a sequence of DNA that initiates the process of transcription. A promoter has to be close to the gene that is being transcribed while an enhancer does not need to be close to the gene of interest.

In other words MUC5b expression likely a function of genetic and non-genetic factors.[@Evans2016]

Publically available data through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) suggest MUC5b promotor site is a complex area of the genome with many transcriptional factors showing evidence of binding

Gene expression profile in IPF characterised by gees assc with tissue remodelling, epitheliaol, and muyofiobroblast genes whereas HP associated with inflammation, t-cell activation and immuine responses[@Selman2006]

The frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10\% in European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950) but is less than 1\% in African and East Asian populations; this is consistent with strong positive selection. The SNV is associated with increased MUC5b expression in the airways and this may have conferred a survival advantage by providing protection against lung infection.[@Jaramillo2018] Also not subject to negative selection due to risk of IPF since onset is well after reproductive age.[@Evans2016] 

possibly improved survival in IPF [@Peljto2013] and lower bacterial burden[@Molyneaux2014]

failure of immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon gamma, ethanercept, prednisolone, azathioprine and N-acetylcysteine[@WarheitNiemi2019] to prolong survival in IPF, together with the observation that the bacterial load is increased in IPF[@Molyneaux2014] and antibiotic use may be associated with improved survival[@Shulgina2013] and evidence from mice ([@ODwyer2019])

on the other the inflammatory response is a response to injury and may be caused by inorganic respirable toxins such as silica or asbesotsis.[@Dostert2008] 

IL-1β, or interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IRAP), are elevated in AMs of patients with ILD, including IPF, sarcoidosis, and asbestosis 82, 83, 84. [@Byrne2016]

asbestos like silica is used in animal models of ipf[@Mohning2019]


Stimulated MUC5B production from epithelial cells has been directly linked to antibacterial defense and enhanced alveolar macrophage function,12 and is inducible by PAMPs such as β-glucan14 and by some NF-κB-mediated cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-17A).15 [@LeivaJuarez2018] 


innate immune activation of Nalp3 inflammasome by asbestos and silica leads to increased IL-1\beta.[@Dostert2008] this is mediated by asbestos and silica causing damage resulting in DAMPs recogniszed by the NLRP3 inflammasome.[@Howrylak2017]

The development of pulmonary fibrosis is strongly associated with increased age, with most
cases developing in adults over 50 years of age (147). This age-related increase in fibrotic lung
disease appears to be due in part to greater activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Studies per-
formed in a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis showed larger levels of morbidity
and mortality in older mice compared to younger ones. Moreover, older mice had enhanced levels
of NLRP3 activity, as well as increased levels of IL-1β and IL-18.[@Howrylak2017][@StoutDelgado2016]

innate immunity prob important; TOLLIP, roll of macrophages etc [@ODwyer2019a]

TOLLIP assoc with incresed suceptibility to ipf and normally functions as negative regulatoro of TLR signalling[@WarheitNiemi2019]

Inflammasomes are key inflammatory signaling platforms that detect microbial substances (pathogen associated molecular patternrs - PAMPS), sterile environmental insults, and molecules derived from host cells (damage associated molecular patterns - DAMPS). Activation of the inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and pyroptosis. Key first step is priming mediated by TLR activation and upregularion of NF-kB to
increase transcroption of inflammasome componenet genes and transcription of pro IL-1B. Second step is the asemply of the multiprotein complex and activation of caspase 1. [@WarheitNiemi2009]



In non-Hispanic whites in the COPDGene cohort with interstitial features (n=454), the MUC5B promoter polymorphism was associated with a 61% lower odds of a prospectively reported acute respiratory disease event (P=0.001), a longer time-to-first event (HR=0.57; P=0.006) and 40% fewer events (P=0.016). The MUC5B promoter polymorphism may have a beneficial effect on the risk of acute respiratory disease events in smokers with interstitial CT features.[@Ash2018]

Increasing precelalance of IPF may be explained to an extent by our aging populationini[@Evans2016]

OR as high as 6.6 for GT versus GG, and 20 for TT versus GG.
Elevated risk associated with rs35705950 is substantially higher than for most other common risk variants for cxomplex disease with exception of human leukocyte angigen (HLA) region for some autoimmune diseases suchs as T1 DM and SLE which have OR greater than 10.
[@Evans2016]



Advances in our understanding of IPF susceptibility now permit study of host-exposure interactions. The minor-allele of the rs35705950 SNP in the promotor region of the mucin 5B gene was found to be present in 38\% of IPF patients but just 9\% of controls.[@Seibold2011] The polymorphism results in excess MUC5B protein in the airway, impaired clearance of inhaled substances and a chronic inflammatory burden on the alveolar surface.[@Seibold2011] The association is allele dose-dependent, has been replicated in independent cohorts, and may affect survival (in what direction is contested).[@Ley2013][@Seibold2011][@Peljto2013][@Dudbridge2019] Two large GWASs have confirmed the observed associations of IPF with MUC5B and other loci.[@Fingerlin2013][@Noth2013]
