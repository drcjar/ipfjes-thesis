## Introduction

### Mucus, Mucins, MUC5b: structure, function and evolutionary importance

Mucus is an essential part of the innate immune system, considered to be universal within most phyla of both aquatic and teresterial meazoans. It plays a piviotal role in the prevention of disease by serving as an antimicrobial barier, it also has physiological functions including allowing the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutirent and metabolites, lubricating surfaces and reducing damage due to sheer, reducing deydration of the epithelia and providing the polymeric matrix which enables ciliary-mucus particle transport. Mucus barriers are essential for the separation and protection of an organism from its external environment, and likely a prerequisite for the exclusion of bacteria from bobily tissues and evolution of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The importance of mucus barriers is further underlined when one considers the energy investment organisms make in continuous mucus production and release consumes; for example, corals use mucus to trap particiles and transport them towards their mouths and the reef-building coral Acropora acuminata is thought to dedicate up to 40% of its daily net carbon fixation to this task alone.[@Bakshani2018] Mucins are a key component of mucus, they are highly evolutionary conserved large glycoproteins that date back around 600 million years to Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, which is an early marine invertebrate. The earliest human mucin analgoue is found in Xenopus tropicalis, the African clawed frog, which evolved about 300 million years ago and mucins are the likely explanation for the observation that frogs show such great resistance to infection during disection and it has been shown that knockdown of mucin in the skin mucus barrier of Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles leads to susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila.[@Dubaissi2018]

The mucin family is composed of proteins that contain tandom repeat structures with a high proportion of prolines, threonines, and serines; the PTS domain. It is further defined by extensive glycosylation of the PTS domain through N-Acetylgalactosamine O-linkages at the threonine and serine residues.[@Kufe2009] The resultant oligisaccharide chains and polymeric structure create the viscoeleastic properties of mucus which confer its barrier properties and play an important role in storage and secreation. [@Bakshani2018] Mucins are 50-90% carbohydrate and they are anionic because most of their terminal sugars contain carboxyl or sulphate groups. Mucin glycan helps to sequested pathogen by acting as 'decoys' and providing sites for microbal adhesins to bind, for example human salivary MUC5b interacts with streptococcal species, patterns of glycosolation change during inflammation.[@Linden2008][@Jaramillo2018] Mucin barriers can be subverted by pathogens, strategies include production of enzymes to degrade mucin core proteins and mucin carbohydrates and effective motility through mucus gels; many mucosal bacterial pahtogens are flagellated for this reason. There is also evidence that degradative enzymes are required for pathogeneisis is species such as Vibrio cholorae and that flagella are required for infectivity in species such as Helicobacter pylori.[@Linden2008] Intracellular gel-forming mucins are stored in a compact and condensed form in granules within mucus-serceting cells. They are stored in solution with a high concentration of calcium ions and protons which is thought to be necessary to mask the anionic charge and prevent electrostatic repulsion, upon secreation mucins expand 1000-3000 fold taking up water to form a gel as calcium is exchanged for sodium and the pH rises.[@Bakshani2018] One consequence of mucins being stored in such a compact form is that when they're released they can obstruct the airway which in mouse models appears necessary for the clearance of helminth infection.[@Jaramillo2018]

Normal human respiratory mucus is 97\% water and 3\%solids (mucins, non-mucins, salts, lipids, and cellular debris). Mucin hypersecreation may increase the concentration of solids up to 15\% resulting in viscous elastic mucus that is not easily cleared.[@Fahy2010] 17 genes encoding mucins in the human genome of which the gene products of seven are secreted and the remainder are membrane bound. Five of the secreted mucins have terminal cysteine rich domains that can form disulfide bonds resulting in polymers that impart the properties of a gel. MUC5AC and MUC5B, two secreated gel-forming mucins, are strongly expressed in the human respartory tract. MUC5AC is predominantly expressed in the conducting airways and MUC5B is predominantly expressed in the respiratory airways (muc5b is also expressed in salivary glands, cervix, gallbladder, seminal fluid, and middle ear epithelium). Secreted mucins are large glycoproteins (up to 3x10^6 D per monomer), ranking among the largest molecules encoded in mammalian genomes, and their expression induces and requires an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.[@Dickey2017] Mucin production and secreation are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Production is highly regulated at transriptional level. The ErbB family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its first discovered member. ErbB-receptor signaling appears important for MUC5AC produciton since inhibition blocks MUC5AC up-regulation by diverse stimuli. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, CD4 cells, Natural killer T cell, Mast cell, Basophil cells, Eosinophil cells and Nuocyte cells. IL-13 is a central regulator in IgE synthesis, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, fibrosis and chitinase up-regulation. It is a mediator of allergic inflammation and different diseases including asthma. IL-13 appears important because it increases MUC5AC expression (IL-1\beta appears to be an important stimulus for MUC5b expression[@Jaramillo2018]). Basal levels of production and secreation of MUC5AC and MUC5B change as part of an allergic response. The production of MUC5AC can increase 40-200 times as high as normal levels in humans with similar findings in mice, MUC5B increases more modestly, 3 to 10 times in mice. The most important stimulus for secretion appears to be ATP which acts on apical membrane purinergenic (P2Y~2~) receptors. Once secreted mucus gel is propelled in a proximal direction towards the mouth, by ciliary beating as part of the mucociliary escalator, where is expectorated or swallowed. [@Fahy2010] 

### MUC5b rs3570950 and respiratory disease

Expression and localisation of MUC5AC and MUC5B is different in patients with lung disease compared with health controls. MUC5AC expression is increased in asthma for example, while MUC5B expression is increased in COPD[@Kesimer2017] and IPF. In COPD MUC5b expression occurs in more proximal airways, whereas in IPF it localised to the bronchiole.[@Helling2017] MUC5b appears to be particularly important in IPF. 

The gain of function promotor variant rs5270590, 3.5 kb upstream of the mucin 5b (MUC5B) transcriptional start site, is the strongest identified risk factor (genetic or otherwise) for the development of either sporadic or familial IPF. The largest study to date (1616 non-hispanic white patients with fibrotic interstitial pneumonias and 4683 controls) estimated that the odds of developing pulmonary fibrosis for those with one copy of the risk allele were 4.5 times (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) the odds of those with no copies and that the odds for those with two copies are 20.2 times those with no copies (95% CI: 15.2â€“27.0).[@Fingerlin2013] The strength of association is substantially higher than for most other common risk variants for complex disease with exception of human leukocyte angigen (HLA) region for some autoimmune diseases suchs as type-1 diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythmaotsis which have OR greater than 10. The association between rs35705950 has been replicated in 3 genome wide association studies (GWAS) and a total of 10 independant cohorts including a mexican cohort and two asian cohorts and is thought to account for about a third of IPF cases.[@Evans2016] However, penetrance is low with up to 20\% of non-hispanic whites having a least one copy of the variant yet IPF occuring only rarely. The rs35705950 variant is a G-to-T transversion that occurs in an area of the MUC5B 5' flanking region which has characteristics of being an enhancer region subject to epigentic control via dna methylation and histone modification.[@Helling2017] An enhancer is a sequence of DNA that functions to enhance transcription. A promoter is a sequence of DNA that initiates the process of transcription. A promoter has to be close to the gene that is being transcribed while an enhancer does not need to be close to the gene of interest. Publically available data through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) suggest MUC5b promotor site is a complex area of the genome with many transcriptional factors showing evidence of binding.[@Selman2006] In other words MUC5b expression likely a function of genetic and non-genetic factors.[@Evans2016] In addition to IPF, rs35705950 has been found to be positively associated with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis associated interstitial lung disease (AAV-ILD).[@Namba2019] It has also been found to not be associated with cutaenous systemic sclerois interstital lung disease (SSc-ILD), sarcoidosis, and myositis-ILD. [@Adegunsoye2019] 


#### Potential role in IPF pathogenesis (and normal function inc make the point penetrance low need something else too e.g occ exposure and bring in recent review and coal dust)

The rs5270590 variant is associated with a 34 fold increase in expression of MUC5b compared with wild type in healthy control populations and a 5 fold increase in patients with IPF (see figure 1).[@Evans2016] In IPF patients distal airway MUC5b is expressed preferentially, compared with MUC5Ac. MUC5b also expressed in honeycomb cysts, a defining characteristic of the usual interstitial pneumonia CT pattern typically seen in IPF.[@Seibold2013]  

![MUC5b expression (Evans 2016)](figure/muc5b_expression.jpg)

Proposed mechanisms for the role of the rs5270590 variant in the pathogenesis of IPF include:

1. excessive production of MUC5B by stem cells that attempt to regenerate injured bronchiolar and alvelar epithelium could disrupt normal development pathways and highjack normal repartive mechanisms of the distal lung resulting in fibroprolferation and honeycomb cyst formation. 
2. excessive MUC5B production leads to reduced mucocilary function, retention of particles, and enhanced lung injury. 
3. interaction between MUC5b and motile cilia since distinct cilium gene expression in IPF lung has been observed. 
4. excessive MUC5b production inducing endoplasmic retiulum stress and the unfolded protein response.[@Evans2016]

Muc5b has been studied in mice. A Mub5b knockout mouse study found that muc5b is essential for mucociliary clearance, for controlling airway and middle ear infections, and maintaining immune homeostasis in the lungs. Knockout mice had airflow limitation and died from infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus.[@Roy2014] A trangenic muc5b mouse model of muc5b overexpression found that overexpression causes mucociliary dysfuction and ehnhances lung fibrosis on response to bleomycin.[@Hancock2018] Intriguingly, in a recent bleomycin lung fibrosis model study lung fibrosis was attenuated in both germ-free mice and IL-17B deficient mice, supporting the concept that fibrosis in response to epithelial injury is mediated by interaction of the immune system with microbiota.[@Yang2019]

### inf/immunity
The frequency of the disease associated allele at rs35705950 exceeds 10\% in European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35705950) but is less than 1\% in African and East Asian populations. Clearly the rs35705950 variant is not subject to negative selection due to IPF risk since onset is well after the reproductive age begins[@Evans2016]; the variation in frequency observed is consistent with strong positive selection. The increased MUC5b expression in the airways associated with the rs35705950 variant may have conferred a survival advantage by providing protection against lung infection.[@Jaramillo2018] A relation between the rs35705950 variant, disease risk, and infection is also supported by the 


possibly improved survival in IPF [@Peljto2013] and lower bacterial burden[@Molyneaux2014]
failure of immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon gamma, ethanercept, prednisolone, azathioprine and N-acetylcysteine[@WarheitNiemi2019] to prolong survival in IPF, together with the observation that the bacterial load is increased in IPF[@Molyneaux2014] and antibiotic use may be associated with improved survival[@Shulgina2013] and evidence from mice ([@ODwyer2019])
Stimulated MUC5B production from epithelial cells has been directly linked to antibacterial defense and enhanced alveolar macrophage function,12 and is inducible by PAMPs such as Î²-glucan14 and by some NF-ÎºB-mediated cytokines (e.g., IL-1Î², IL-17A).15 [@LeivaJuarez2018] 


innate immunity prob important; TOLLIP, roll of macrophages etc [@ODwyer2019a]
TOLLIP assoc with incresed suceptibility to ipf and normally functions as negative regulatoro of TLR signalling[@WarheitNiemi2019]

In non-Hispanic whites in the COPDGene cohort with interstitial features (n=454), the MUC5B promoter polymorphism was associated with a 61% lower odds of a prospectively reported acute respiratory disease event (P=0.001), a longer time-to-first event (HR=0.57; P=0.006) and 40% fewer events (P=0.016). The MUC5B promoter polymorphism may have a beneficial effect on the risk of acute respiratory disease events in smokers with interstitial CT features.[@Ash2018]

Inflammasomes are key inflammatory signaling platforms that detect microbial substances (pathogen associated molecular patternrs - PAMPS), sterile environmental insults, and molecules derived from host cells (damage associated molecular patterns - DAMPS). Activation of the inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18 and pyroptosis. Key first step is priming mediated by TLR activation and upregularion of NF-kB to
increase transcroption of inflammasome componenet genes and transcription of pro IL-1B. Second step is the asemply of the multiprotein complex and activation of caspase 1. [@WarheitNiemi2009]

muc5b overexpressed in ipf, expressed in abberant location, poss mechs + survival benefit [@Dickey2017]

### env stim
on the other the inflammatory response is a response to injury and may be caused by inorganic respirable toxins such as silica or asbesotsis.[@Dostert2008] 
IL-1Î², or interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IRAP), are elevated in AMs of patients with ILD, including IPF, sarcoidosis, and asbestosis 82, 83, 84. [@Byrne2016]
asbestos like silica is used in animal models of ipf[@Mohning2019]
innate immune activation of Nalp3 inflammasome by asbestos and silica leads to increased IL-1\beta.[@Dostert2008] this is mediated by asbestos and silica causing damage resulting in DAMPs recogniszed by the NLRP3 inflammasome.[@Howrylak2017]
our review

### age

Increasing precelalance of IPF may be explained to an extent by our aging populationini[@Evans2016]

The development of pulmonary fibrosis is strongly associated with increased age, with most
cases developing in adults over 50 years of age (147). This age-related increase in fibrotic lung
disease appears to be due in part to greater activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Studies per-
formed in a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis showed larger levels of morbidity
and mortality in older mice compared to younger ones. Moreover, older mice had enhanced levels
of NLRP3 activity, as well as increased levels of IL-1Î² and IL-18.[@Howrylak2017][@StoutDelgado2016]
