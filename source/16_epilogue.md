## IPFJES in context, radiological UIP with a history of occupational asbestos exposure: IPF, asbestosis, and 25 fibre-ml.years

### Introduction

Diagnostic criteria for IPF and asbestosis can be difficult to apply in
patients with a history of radiological UIP and occupational asbestos
exposure. Here I briefly review how IPF and asbestosis are diagnosed and
how this has changed. Then I examine the history of '25 fibre-ml' years
in relation to asbestosis and appraise its utility in attributing UIP to
asbestos in the context of the IPFJES findings.

### How IPF is diagnosed

Historically, that which is now called IPF has been otherwise known. For
example, in 1971 cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) was defined by
Turner-Warwick and Haslam[@TurnerWarwick1971] as applying to patients with:

1.  no identifiable cause for lung fibrosis identified on the basis of
    detailed occupational and clinical history
2.  widespread irregular shadowing on chest xray and widespread crackles
    on auscultation
3.  if a biopsy was performed then histological features of alveolar
    fibrosis and the absence of granuloma or intra alveolar organisation
    or evidence of pneumoconiosis

Turner-Warwick[@Turner-Warwick1998] acknowledges potential difficulties in
establishing attribution and causality in IPF. She observes that there
is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied
to exclude IPF; some clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential
cause is identified, others only when there is clear exposure to an
established cause.

As technologies such as high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) became
widely available and our understanding of idiopathic interstitial
pneumonias developed diagnostic nomenclature have been updated. Most
significantly, in 2000, an international consensus definition of IPF as
UIP on HRCT +/- biopsy in an idiopathic setting was reached. Wells
2018[@Wells2018] provides a detailed discussion of the evolution of
modern IPF nomenclature. The 2011 joint ERS/ATS guidelines[@Raghu2011],
current at the initiation of IPFJES, state that the diagnosis of IPF
requires:

1.  exclusion of other known causes of ILD (e.g., domestic and
    occupational environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and
    drug toxicity).
2.  the presence of a UIP pattern on HRCT in patients not subjected to
    surgical lung biopsy
3.  specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy pattern in
    patients subjected to surgical lung biopsy

Surgical lung biopsy for the diagnosis of IPF has been much less
frequently performed since it was shown to be unnecessary in the context
of typical radiological and clinical findings[@Hunninghake2001] and to
carry a significant mortality and morbidity
risk.[@Utz2001][@Lettieri2005]

In the UK, National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical
practice guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of IPF is made at a
multidisciplinary team meeting which (minimally) includes a chest
physician, a radiologist, and a histopathologist, with expertise in ILD.
This approach resulted in moderate inter-rater agreement among UK
physicians in a international case-cohort study, weighted kappa 0.61
(0.50-0.67), and good prognostic accuracy, median hazards ratio for
death comparing IPF to non-IPF ILD was 2.76 (1.97-3.69).[@Walsh2017]

### How asbestosis is diagnosed

The first report of fibrosis of the lungs due to inhalation of asbestos
dust[@Cooke1924] appeared in the British Medical Journal in 1924 and
described the case of Nellie Kershaw, an English textile worker from who
worked for Turner Brothers Asbestos spinning raw asbestos fibre into
yarn. Kershaw died aged 33 years and was found to have extensive lung
fibrosis and asbestos fibres at post mortem, having worked with asbestos
textiles since age 13. The inquest into her death led to a parliamentary
enquiry that formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis and this
in turn led to the introduction of asbestos industry regulations in
1931.[@Tweedale2000]

Asbestos industry regulations included the provision of independent
medical boards to diagnose asbestosis. By the 1960s asbestosis was
diagnosed by medical boards based on a history of asbestos exposure from
working in a "scheduled area", part of an asbestos factory where a
manufacturing process such as carding was carried out, plus two positive
findings from the following:

1.  the presence of basal rales
2.  finger-clubbing
3.  radiological appearances and pulmonary function studies

The medical boards have been subject to criticism for their
conservatism, financial links to asbestos industry, and failure to
protect workers.[@Tweedale1998]

In 1963, a statement from the Committee on the Pneumoconiosis of the
Council of on Occupational Health of the American Medical Association
discusses asbestosis and suggests diagnosis should be, as with other
pneumoconiosis, based on:

1.  an appropriate occupational history; hazardous substance is present
    in patients work environment and they have been significantly
    exposed to it
2.  abnormal roentgen shadows
3.  compatible clinical picture (accepting that symptoms, for example
    progressive exertional dyspnoea, will rarely be distinctive enough
    to support diagnosis)

In 1986, a statement from the American Thoracic Society on the diagnosis
of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos[@Murphy1986] recommended
that the term asbestosis should be reserved for interstitial fibrosis of
the pulmonary parenchyma in which asbestos bodies or fibres may be
demonstrated. However, they acknowledge that clinically the diagnosis of
asbestosis must be made without the benefit of histological examination
of lung tissue since lung biopsy is rarely indicated or carried out.
They suggest that indirect methods of asbestos exposure must be used and
that the diagnosis does not require any measurable impairment of lung
function or physical disability to be present. Specific necessary
clinical diagnostic criteria suggested are:

1.  A reliable history of exposure
2.  An appropriate time interval between exposure and detection

Optional additional criteria suggested are:

1.  Chest roentgenographic evidence of type "s", "t", "u", small
    irregular opacifications of profusion 1/1 or greater
2.  A restrictive pattern of lung impairment with a forced vital capacity
    below the lower limit of normal
3.  Bilateral late or pan inspiratory crackles at the posterior lung
    bases not cleared by cough

with a recommendation that emphasis be given to radiological findings.

In 1997 The International Expert Meeting on Asbestos, Asbestosis, and
Cancer was convened in Helsinki to discuss asbestos related lung and
pleural disorders and to agree diagnostic criteria.[@Tossavainen1997]
They point out that neither asbestos associated clinical features nor
architectural tissue abnormalities sufficiently differ from other causes
of interstitial fibrosis to allow confident diagnosis without a history
of significant asbestos exposure or the detection of asbestos fibres or
bodies in the lung greatly in excess of that commonly seen in the
general population. The 1997 guideline introduces cumulative
occupational asbestos exposure of 25 fibre-ml years as the being
associated with a 2-fold increase in lung cancer risk and the level at
which clinical cases of asbestosis may occur.

The 1997 report[@Tossavainen1997] also recommends adoption of the Roggli-Pratt modification of the CAP-NIOSH
system for the histological grading of asbestosis[@Sporn2004] and, in
relation to histological grading, the 2014 update[@Wolff2015] cites 2010
diagnostic criteria from the Asbestosis Committee of the College of
American Pathologists and Pulmonary Pathology Society.[@Roggli2010]
These diagnostic criteria include discussion of a 25 fibre-ml years
exposure threshold for diagnosis of asbestosis. The authors acknowledge
that biopsy is seldom required but argue that when it is undertaken
asbestos bodies are required for a histological diagnosis of asbestosis.
The 2014 update[@Wolff2015] has been criticised for claiming that a
confident diagnosis of asbestosis can not be made without the presence
of a history of asbestos exposure or the presence of asbestos bodies.
The inclusion of reference to a cumulative exposure 25 fibre-ml years is
criticised both because of uncertainties about the evidence base for the
threshold and because of concern that it is impractical for clinicians
to implement, there not being a well established means to arrive at a
fibre-ml year estimate. The requirement for demonstration of asbestos
bodies is criticised because of known variability in the biopersistence
of inhaled asbestos fibres and limitations of quantification
methods.[@Baur2016]

### Radiological UIP with a history of occupational asbestos exposure: IPF, asbestosis, and 25 fibre-ml.years

If one accepts that IPF is a diagnosis of exclusion and can only be made
after alternative causes of lung fibrosis such as asbestosis are
excluded then making a confident diagnosis of asbestosis becomes key.
Writing in Thorax over 20 years ago Turner-Warwick[@Turner-Warwick1998]
raised an important potential difficulty in IPF diagnosis. Specifically,
that there is variation in clinical practice with respect to the standard applied to exclude IPF; some
clinicians exclude IPF when exposure to a potential cause is identified,
others only when there is clear exposure to an established cause.

Determining if asbestos exposure is a potential or established cause of
an individual's UIP is non-trivial. Successive asbestosis diagnosis
guidelines have consistently recognised that the clinical features of
and radiological findings seen in asbestosis are insufficiently distinct from
other causes of interstitial fibrosis to allow confident diagnosis
without a history of significant asbestos exposure or the detection of
asbestos fibres in the lung. They have also acknowledged both that
individual genetic susceptibility factors are important determinants of
disease risk, but these are not well characterised and not tested in
routine clinical practice, and that it is seldom justified to obtain
tissue biopsy for the purposes of asbestosis diagnosis. The result is
that assessing whether a patient has a history of significant asbestos
exposure becomes the key diagnostic criteria.

Logically, there are four prerequisites to assessing whether an
individual patient has a history of significant (enough to cause
fibrosis) asbestos exposure.

1.  The relationship between asbestos exposure and asbestosis risk must
    be known, specifically how much exposure is required for how much
    risk?
2.  A means of assessing the amount of asbestos exposure
    an individual patient has had
3.  Knowledge of individual susceptibility factors and the magnitude of risk that they
    carry
4.  An agreed level of risk for attributing fibrosis to
    asbestos exposure rather than calling it idiopathic or attributing
    it to another inhaled fibrogenic exposure e.g silica

Issues include the unreliability of historic measurements and diagnoses,
changed workplace exposure and demographic of potential cases, lack of
good comparator group data to compare the exposure of cases against, and
incomplete data on individual genetic susceptibility factors,
particularly in relation to gene-environment interaction, and severely limit
the task.

The 1984 report of the Royal Commissionon on matters of health and safety arising from
the use of asbestos in Ontario[@Dupre1984] suggests 25 fibre-ml years as a 'best guess'
for the level of exposure below which fibrotic process cannot advance to the point of clinical manifestation based on
previous studies.
 
However the report also admits the significant limitations of studies of
asbestos exposure and asbestosis incidence including instruments used to measure ambient exposure,
duration of follow up, and measurement of co-exposures such as silica or smoking. The report draws attention to the importance of host susceptibility:

"We recognize that among some cohorts studied, even workers in the lower
cumulative exposure categories have died as a result of asbestosis. We
recognize too that variations in susceptibility among individuals make
it difficult to have any confidence in a no-effect or threshold level."

It is interesting to consider whether in such a circumstance (of lower levels of asbestos exposure in the population) host susceptibility factors become more important. IPFJES data appear to support this. The majority of individuals with UIP in IPFJES do not have 'heavy', defined as greater than 25 fibre-ml years, asbestos exposure, in line with progressive asbestos exposure regulation leading to a reduction in population asbestos exposure.

We find evidence of interaction between carriage of the minor allele of MUC5b rs35705950, smoking, and asbestos exposure, to increase risk of UIP. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of this risk is greater for those with 'heavy' exposure. This has parallels with the Geofrey Roses' prevention paradox; the majority of cases of disease come from a population at low or moderate risk of that disease, and only a minority of cases come from the high risk population (of the same disease) because the number of people at high risk is small.[@Rose1981]

But what to do pragmatically with respect to diagnosis?

The approach taken potentially affects a large number of people. Interstitial lung abnormalities including UIP are increasingly recognised as a common feature on CT of the lung in older individuals, occurring in 4-9% of smokers and 2-7% of non-smokers.[@Hatabu2020] Many interstitial lung abnormalities may be described as having an indeterminate for UIP pattern[@Hunninghake2019] compatible with a diagnosis of IPF[@Raghu2018] (or asbestosis).

IPFJES found the majority (over 60%) of cases, and controls, to have been ever exposed to asbestos, defined
as ever having a job that was medium or high risk for asbestos exposure on the basis of proportional
mortality data for pleural mesothlioma.[@Peto2009]

It's possible that genetic susceptibility factors are interacting with asbestos to cause UIP which, if known, might be properly called asbestosis. This appears to be the case with the minor allele of MUC5b rs35705950 and smoking in IPFJES. However, something other than asbestos might also be causing UIP, which, if it can't be known, is properly called IPF. With no observable difference in rates of asbestos exposure between cases and controls, and no knowledge of individual susceptibility, diagnosing IPF seems the more parsimonious thing to do. Further study of potential gene-environment interactions in patients with UIP is needed to fully understand the contribution asbestos makes to disease risk.

### Conclusion

IPF and asbestosis are hard to distinguish because there are frequently few or no distinguishing features clinically, including on the basis of an exposure history, or on CT, and a biopsy is not usually done. There is clear practice variation in the standard applied to exclude IPF; is identification of a potential cause sufficient or is clear exposure to an established cause necessary?

When the potential cause being considered is asbestos difficulties arise because it is difficult to quantify asbestos exposure (and relatedly to accurately diagnose asbestosis) so the relationship between asbestos exposure and risk of asbestosis is ill-defined, host susceptibility to asbestos is known to be important but gene-environment interactions are poorly characterised and patients are not usually genotyped, and there is not clear agreement on the level of risk asbestosis (and corresponding exposure) required for diagnosis.

One might argue that an individual with UIP who has any degree of asbestos exposure has asbestosis due to asbestos interacting with assumed host susceptibility factors. One might equally argue that an individual with UIP who has any degree of asbestos exposure does not have asbestosis because asbestos exposure alone does not appear to make any significant contribution to UIP at a population level for current levels of asbestos exposure and there is insufficient evidence for asbestos interaction with host susceptibility factors being an important contributor to UIP.  
 
IPFJES tells us that a history of asbestos exposure alone does not increase risk of UIP but that in concert with smoking and genetic susceptibility factors it does increase risk, and the increase in risk is greater for more heavily exposed individuals. We are left to decide our thresholds for using the identification of asbestos as a potential cause of UIP in an individual as a reason to exclude IPF, and to diagnose asbestosis, with limited data.
