# Asbestos exposure assessment

## Introduction

Most previous work has relied on self-reported workplace exposure information, an approach that is open to recall bias and deals poorly with confounding. 

Lifetime occupational histories are more accurately recalled than self-reported workplace exposures and can be combined with measures such as mesothelioma occupational mortality proportionate mortality (PMR) estimates and job-process assessments to minimize recall bias and more accurately characterise cumulative exposures. [@Teschke2002][@Bourgkard2013][@Cherrie1999][@Rake2009] This allows too the examination of `exposure-response' relationships, entirely lacking in the published literature.
