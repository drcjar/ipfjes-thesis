# Exposure assessment

## Introduction

In addition to its epidemiological and clinical plausibility there are several additional reasons why study of this area is needed.  First, most previous work relied on self-reported workplace exposure information, an approach that is open to recall bias and deals poorly with confounding; for example, studies have described strong associations between metal work and IPF and specify sheet metal workers[@Iwai1994][@Scott1990][@Hubbard2000], a group who are frequently exposed to dust containing asbestos fibres[@Welch1994] and who in a recent UK study, had the highest risk of mesothelioma.[@Rake2009] Lifetime occupational histories are more accurately recalled than self-reported workplace exposures and can be combined with measures such as proportionate mortality (PMR) estimates and job-process assessments to minimize recall bias and more accurately characterise cumulative exposures. [@Teschke2002][@Bourgkard2013][@Cherrie1999][@Rake2009] This allows too the examination of `exposure-response' relationships, entirely lacking in the published literature.
