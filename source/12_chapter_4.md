# Asbestos exposure assessment: can it be done?

<!--
Reviews asbestos exposure assessment with particular reference to using job titles and cherries thingy and attribution

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

## Introduction

Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic. 

Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung they can be sampled by lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage. 

Historic workplace measurments are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurment technique at the time of assessment and do not necessarily generalize well. 

Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.[@DeVuyst1998] 

Modern validated quantitative exposure reconstruction methods integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.[@Cherrie1999]  

Finally, job-exposure matricies (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title.  

The asbestos exposure assessment literature is recognised to be at risk of bias arising from its economic importance to industrial and medicolegal actors. 

We critically review different means of asbestos exposure assessment and consider their research and clinical utility.

## Method

We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of "asbestos", "exposure assessment", together with terms for modes of assessment including "lung biopsy", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "exposure reconstruction", and "job-exposure matrix". 

## Results

### Lung biopsy

The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust[@Cooke1924] included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundent asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis. 

The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestosis because counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.[@IIAC2005] 

As alluded to previously lung biopsy carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function. Therefore it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.[@Baur2014]

Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have recently been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls[@Rake2009][@Gilham2015] and in a follow up study where asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to show that population amphibole burden tracks mesothelioma mortality.[@Gilham2018]

### Exposure reconstruction
   The   paper describes a potentially valuable exposure assessment method for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The exposure assessment model is logical and the validation data is compelling. Theoretically the model would result in a more granular estimation of exposure than alternative estimation methods relying on job-title alone. The approach is limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for
   validation which is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data.

### Job-exposure matrices 

[@Oyen2015][@Peters2016]

One recent novel JEM[@Rake2009] assigned risk of exposure using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation.

## Discussion

IIRAC
ANT


Attribution, specifically the required threshold of asbestos exposure (as assessed by various means) that must be crossed before it is possible to say that, for example, scarring of the lung with an usual interstital pneumonia pattern in an individual patient is caused by asbestos exposure, carries medicolegal in addition to scientific importance has not been well established for several assessment methodolgies.
