# Historic asbestos exposure assessment: can it be done?

<!--
Reviews asbestos exposure assessment with particular reference to using job titles and cherries thingy and attribution

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

?should we have a separate section for "qualatative" assessment by hygeinst

do i need to go into biopersistance more

what is exposure? biological exposure etc

## Introduction

Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic. 

Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung they can be sampled by lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or at autopsy. 

Historic workplace measurements are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurement technique at the time of assessment; they do not necessarily generalize well. 

Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.[@DeVuyst1998] 

Expert assessment and exposure modelling approaches integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.[@Cherrie1999]

Job-exposure matrices (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title.  

Finally, self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to, these are usually elicited by questionnaire or at interview.

The asbestos exposure assessment literature presents difficulties for review because it is large and recognised to be at risk of bias as a result of its economic importance to powerful industrial and medicolegal actors[@Nemery2017].  

Here we critically review different means of historic asbestos exposure assessment and consider their clinical and research utility.

## Method

We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of "asbestos", "exposure assessment", together with terms for modes of assessment including "lung biopsy", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "exposure reconstruction", and "job-exposure matrix". 

## Results

### Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage

The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust[@Cooke1924] included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundant asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis. 

The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestos exposure because fibres, particularly chrysotile fibres, may be cleared from the lung and counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.[@DeVuyst1998] 

Despite this recent 2014 Helsinki guidelines[@Wolff2015] and UK Royal College of Pathologist guidelines appear to suggest that a clear history of substantial occupational asbestos exposure is insufficient for diagnosis and that the absence of asbestos bodies or fibre counts above a certain threshold might be used to rule out the diagnosis. The shortcomings of such an approach highlighted above are also described by responses to the Helsinki guideline.[@Hammar2015][@Baur2016][@Baur2017] 

Lung biopsy carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function and it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.[@Baur2016] Therefore, the clinical utility of lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage is limited to ruling in asbestosis when a suggestive exposure history and radiology are lacking.

In a research context lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage have provided valuable population level insights. Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls. Fibre counts were found to be higher in groups with greater occupational risk (as defined by PMR), providing additional support for the pre-eminence of an occupational history.[@Rake2009][@Gilham2016] In a follow up study asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to demonstrated that population amphibole burden is falling and is proportional to mesothelioma mortality.[@Gilham2018]

A similar correlation with occupational exposure history, overall downward trend in fibre counts, and a significant false negative rate has been observed in a recent Belgian study of patients undergoing bronchoscopy with broncheoalvelolar lavage sampling for asbestos fibre quantification.[@Nuyts2017]

### Historic workplace measurements

Occupational hygienists have recorded a large numbers of workplace measurements of asbestos in different settings, at different times, using a variety of different means. These measurements reside in national databases such as the HSE National Exposure Database[@Burns1989], and EV@LUTIL[@Orlowski2015], in the published literature, and in unpublished company records.

The use of different means of making workplace assessments results in difficulties with respect to the accuracy and comparability of measurements. For example, instruments that count particles rather than asbestos fibres have been used and there is no established conversion factor.[@Peto1985] Phase contrast microscopy has also been used which is less sensitive that scanning electron microscopy, which is in turn less sensitive than transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.[@ATSDR2001] 

Where era and task specific workplace exposure data matching a particular patient occupational history is available and readily deniable it is a valuable means of assessing exposure history. Unfortunately, in practice measurements are usually limited to the subset of jobs thought to be potentially harmful "high" exposure jobs at the time of measurement. As awareness of the sources and harm of asbestos exposure has developed overtime the available data, until the use of asbestos was banned in the UK, is also skewed to more recent times.[@Smith1991][@Sahmel2010] 

Measurements have found greater utility in a research setting where they can help to quantify risk and inform regulatory policy and compliance in specific workplace settings, for example, in car mechanics[@Blake2006] or skilled craftsmen.[@Williams2007]

### Exposure reconstruction

Sahmel et al[@Sahmel2010] propose a seven-step framework (see Figure \ref{ssframework}) which they use to enumerate and critique exposure reconstruction approaches.

Reconstruction techniques may be quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative. Quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on data from similar (historic or current) exposure scenarios or simulation studies. Semi-quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on exposure data matrices (using a job-exposure matrix) and/or exposure determinants (using an exposure model). Qualitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on the expert judgement of an industrial hygienist and self reported exposures.[@Sahmel2010]

#### Job-exposure matrices 

Several job-exposure matrices that deal with asbestos have been reported. Pannett et al's 1985 job-exposure matrix for use in population studies in England and Wales[@Pannett1985] found good agreement between job-title assigned categories of exposure (none, low, moderate, high) for asbestos and direct review of the original occupational history by an expert.

Rake et al[@Rake2009] assigned categories risk of exposure (low, medium, high) using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation. This approach has been validated in the same cohort by amphibole fibre counts.[@Gilham2016]

DOM-JEM[@Peters2011] was developed for use in population based multi-centre lung cancer case-control study. It assigns job titles one of three categories of asbestos exposure (no exposure, low exposure, high exposure) based on the consensus of three independent expert raters. DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (\ensuremath{\kappa = 0.17}) but less heterogeneity. In a study applying DOM-JEM to the Netherlands Cohort Study (NCS) DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (K = 0.29).[@Offermans2012]  

The Finish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)[@Kauppinen1998] covers exposure to 84 different agents, including asbestos, for 311 jobs across 9 periods spanning 1945-2015. Era-specific estimates of the mean level of asbestos exposure are available for 27 jobs based on expert assessment and measurement data; the exact details of the grounds for estimates are kept in a proprietary FINJEM database which is not freely available. FINJEM showed poor agreement with
expert assessment of asbestos exposure (\ensuremath{\kappa = 0.23}) but reasonable identification of mesothelioma risk when evaluated using the NCS.[@Offermans2012][@Offermans2014] 

AsbJEM[@Oyen2015] was developed in Australia by an expert panel of three industrial hygienists using all available exposure data. It is based on FINJEM and provides quantitative estimates of annual exposure for 224 occupations across three time periods spanning 1943 to 2004. It also showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure (\ensuremath{\kappa = 0.10})

SYN-JEM[@Peters2016] describes a JEM developed for four carcinogens. It provides quantified asbestos exposure estimates based on 27958 personal measurements (spanning 1971-2009), a mixed effects statistical model, and a priori categorical assessment of exposure (none, low, high). Cherrie et al[@Cherrie2018] point out that SYN-JEM provides little contrast in the modelled exposure level between categories as the geometric mean for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml and that there are wide variations in regional estimates that are difficult to explain. 

JEMS are generally taken to be superior to direct questions about exposures because they are cheaper, have greater validity, and are less vulnerable to differential recall. This is because recall of occupations is not influenced by disease status, coding of occupation is blind to case-control status, and translation of codes into exposure is standardized and can not be influence by disease status of a subject.[@Ahrens1993][@Teschke2002][@Gramond2012] 

Orlowski et al[@Orlowski1993] compared two JEMs with a structured job specific questionnaire (SQ) in a lung cancer case-control study. They found that agreement between the JEMs and the SQ was poor (\ensuremath{\kappa = 0.23-0.27}) and suggested that the sources of error for JEMs were loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and the insufficiency of published data on occupational asbestos exposure.

JEMs are not routinely used in clinical practice because they are not usually available or accessible for specific patients. In a research setting they are frequently helpful though in addition to the strengths and weaknesses outlined about the desirability of reusing an existing JEM vs developing a study specific JEM must be considered.

#### Exposure modelling approaches

Exposure modelling approaches modify existing measurement data on the basis of knowledge of the determinants of exposure. They may be viewed as the formalization of professional decision criteria used by hygienists in their assessment of workplace exposures.[@Smith1991] 
    
A common conceptual framework for this is the source-receptor model source receptor model[@Tielemans2008][@Smith1991] whereby inhalation exposure is considered in terms of an exposure source, a pathway from source to receptor, and the receptor. The model is then used to propose modifying factors such as activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection.[@Tielemans2008]. 

In the hands of some hygienists assessment of historic asbestos exposure based on interview can correlate well with amphibole fibre counts.[@Rodelsperger2001] By extension, exposure modelling approaches, using industrial hygienist methods, might be expected to be useful. Exposure modelling approaches make strong intuitive sense; it is known that there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures[@Symanski2006] and, for example, room size and ventilation have been empirically shown to affect the concentration of airborne chemical exposures.[@Cherrie1999a] Further, mathematical exposure models that take account of known exposure modifying factors to estimate past exposures have shown a good correlation with
measured values.[@Cherrie1999]

A quantified validated historic asbestos exposure model[@Cherrie2018] has recently been developed and proposed as a means of for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The approach has the advantage, compared with job-exposure matrices, of providing a more granular quantified exposure assessment, sensitive to the exposure circumstances of the individual. However, the approach is limited by the fact that the individual must recall that they must recall their exposure circumstances which due to the latency of asbestos related disease may have occurred over 30 years ago. The approach is also limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for validation, though is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data. 

Exposure modelling approaches to assessing asbestos exposure have research and clinical utility notwithstanding the limitations outlined above together with the requirement that assessors be appropriately trained.  

    
#### Self-reported exposure

Self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to. Typically this is elicited by asking about a specific exposure via questionnaire or interview. Differential recall of self-reported exposures according to disease status is a concern but few studies have found evidence of this and it appears to be less of an issue when prompted responses, rather than volunteered, responses about occupational exposures are used.[@Teschke2000] 

Most studies comparing self-reported exposures to industrial hygiene measurements have found significant associations but with wide variation in the proportions of variance explained by the self reports. This is not surprising given that it is known there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures.[@Teschke2002][@Symanski2006] 

Studies comparing self-reported exposures to expert assessment find highly variable levels of agreement (\ensuremath{\kappa -0.05 - 0.94}) with a median \ensuremath{\kappa 0.6}
. In two studies comparing self-reported exposures with JEMs, self-reported exposures were more sensitive and of similar or worse specificity.[@Teschke2002] 

Self-reported exposures have been shown to be more accurate for easily sensed exposures such as solvents with a strong smell, dusts with larger particle sizes, and vibrations that can be felt. Providing a reference point, for example using well known machines from a workplace to gauge noise category also improves accuracy.[@Teschke2002]

Self-reported exposures have clinical utility in that they can suggest or support consideration of an occupational cause for disease. Ideally such self-reports are combined with the clinicians knowledge of the likely occupational exposures given the occupational history and other available data to strengthen or weaken the case as appropriate. Similarly, they have utility in a research setting where they may augment other means of assessment.


## Discussion

The accuracy of historic asbestos exposure assessment, by any means, is limited by the paucity of occupational asbestos measurement data, measurement technique limitations, within and between worker exposure variability, and participant recall. There does not exist a universally agreed "gold standard" against which to evaluate methods. Accurate quantified assessment of historic exposure, where evidence is scarce,  may be an impossible task.[@Burstyn2011]

Nonetheless, clinically, historic asbestos exposure assessments must be made for attribution. Specifically, to inform whether the required threshold of asbestos exposure (as assessed by various means) has been crossed so it is possible to say that, for example, scarring of the lung with an usual interstital pneumonia pattern in an individual patient is caused by asbestos exposure. This carries medicolegal in addition to scientific importance and has not been well established by any assessment method.

In the context of mesothelioma case-control studies fibre-counts do at least provide an objective means of assessing historic asbestos exposure against which other means can be compared. It is encouraging that industrial hygienist assessment and assessment using job title and PMR correlates strongly with fibre counts.[@Gramond2012][@Gilham2016] Further and more generally, it is encouraging that estimates from explicit asbestos exposure modelling systems such as Cherrie et al's[@Cherrie2018], show good correlation with measurement data. 


## Conclusion

Quantitative estimates of historic occupational asbestos exposures will generally have high uncertainty. However, less precise measures, such as relative difference in exposure among epidemiological groups may be quite certain even though the numerical estimates are only approximate. This is invaluable in studies examining aetiological hypothesis.[@Smith1991]
