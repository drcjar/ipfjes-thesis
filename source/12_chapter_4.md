## Introduction

Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic. Occupational exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because asbestos fibres persist in tissues they can also be sampled by lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage. 

Historic workplace measurments are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are pauce and dependant on working practices and measurment technique at the time assessment.

Most previous work has relied on self-reported workplace exposure information, an approach that is open to recall bias and deals poorly with confounding. 

Lifetime occupational histories are more accurately recalled than self-reported workplace exposures and can be combined with measures such as mesothelioma occupational mortality proportionate mortality (PMR) estimates and job-process assessments to minimize recall bias and more accurately characterise cumulative exposures. [@Teschke2002][@Bourgkard2013][@Cherrie1999][@Rake2009] This allows too the examination of `exposure-response' relationships, entirely lacking in the published literature.
