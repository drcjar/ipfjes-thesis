# Asbestos exposure assessment: can it be done?

<!--
Reviews asbestos exposure assessment with particular reference to using job titles and cherries thingy and attribution

IIAC say asbestosis can be diagnosed on basis of clinical basis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a history of substantial asbestos exposure.

(Rake2009) Substantial asbestos exposure was defined as working with or disturbing AIB, sprayed coatings, lagging, other asbestos insulation or raw asbestos.

what is exposure? biological exposure etc

## Introduction

Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic. 

Occupational asbestos exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because inhaled asbestos fibres persist in the lung they can be sampled by lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or at autopsy. 

Historic workplace measurments are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurment technique at the time of assessment and do not necessarily generalize well. 

Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and both procedures carry the risk of serious complication including death. Additionally, the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, and establishing appropriate references ranges is challenging.[@DeVuyst1998] 

Modern validated quantitative exposure reconstruction methods integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life.[@Cherrie1999]

Finally, job-exposure matricies (JEMs) are widely used in occupational epidemiology studies to assess exposure to potential hazards. These assign levels of exposure to health hazards on the basis of job title.  

The asbestos exposure assessment literature presents difficulties for review because it is large and recognised to be at risk of bias as a result of its economic importance to powerful industrial and medicolegal actors[@Nemery2017].  

We critically review different means of asbestos exposure assessment and consider their clinical and research utility.

## Method

We searched pubmed and google scholar for combinations and synonyms of "asbestos", "exposure assessment", together with terms for modes of assessment including "lung biopsy", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "exposure reconstruction", and "job-exposure matrix". 

## Results

### Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage

The first report of fibrosis of the lung due to asbestos dust[@Cooke1924] included a description of the post mortem microscopic appearances of the lungs which showed abundent asbestos fibres in areas of fibrosis. 

The demonstration of asbestos fibres on lung biopsy in the context of pulmonary fibrosis is clearly supportive of the diagnosis of asbestosis. However, a failure to demonstrate fibres can not be used to rule out asbestos exposure because fibres, particularly chyrostile fibres, may be cleared from the lung and counting methods have a significant false-negative rate.[@DeVuyst1998] 

Despite this, recent 2014 Helsinki guidelines[@Wolff2015] and UK Royal College of Pathologist guidelines appear to suggest that a clear history of substantial occupational asbestos exposure is insufficient for diagnosis and that the absence of asbestos bodies or fibre counts above a certain threshold might be used to rule out a the diagnosis. The shortcomings of such an approach highlighted above are also described by responses to the Helsinki guideline.[@Hammar2015][@Baur2016][@Baur2017] 

As alluded to previously lung biopsy also carries significant health risks, particularly for patients who already have compromised lung function and it can not be justified solely on medico-legal grounds.[@Baur2014] Therefore, the clinical utility of lung biospy and bronchoalveolar lavage is limited to ruling in asbestosis when a suggestive exposure history and radiology are lacking.

In a research context lung biopsy and brochoalveolar lavage have provided valuable population level insights. Lung biopsy asbestos fibre counts have been examined in a UK case-control study where mesothelioma cases were compared with lung cancer controls. Fibre counts were found to be higher in groups with greater occupational risk (as defined by PMR), providing additional support for the pre-eminance of an occupational history.[@Rake2009][@Gilham2015] In a follow up study asbestos fibre counts from unselected surgically treated pneumothorax patients were used to demonstrated that population amphibole burden is falling and is proportional to mesothelioma mortality.[@Gilham2018]

A similar correlation with occupational exposure history, overall downward trend in fibre counts, and a significant false negative rate has been observed in a recent Belgian study of patients undergoing bronchoscopy with broncheoalvelolar lavage sampling for asbestos fibre quantification.[@Nuyts2016]

### Historic workplace measurements

Occupational hygenists have recorded a large numbers of workplace measurements of asbestos in different settings, at different times, using a variety of different means. These measurements reside in national databases such as the HSE National Exposure Database[@Burns1989], and EV@LUTIL[@Orlowski2015], in the published literature, and in unpublished company records.

The use of different means of making workplace assessments resulting in difficulties with respect to the accuracy and comparability of measurements has been highlighted. For example, instruments that count particles rather than asbestos fibres have been used and there is no established conversion factor.[@Peto1985] Phase contrast microscopy has also been used which is less sensitive that scanning electron microscopy, which is in turn less senisitive than transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.[@ATSDR2001] 

Where era and task specific workplace exposure data matching a particular patient occupational history is available and readily identiable it is a valuable means of assessing exposure history. Unfortunately, this is a rare occurence.

Measurements have found greater utility in a research setting where they can help to quantify risk and inform regulatory policy and compliance in specific workplace settings, for example, in car mechanics[@Blake2006] or skilled craftsmen.[@Williams2007]


### Exposure reconstruction

Sahmel et al[@Sahmel2010] propose a seven-step framework (see Figure \ref{ssframework}) which they use to enumerate and critique exposure reconstuction approaches.

Reconstruction techniques may be quanitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitive. Quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on data from similar (historic or current) exposure scenarios or simulation studies. Semi-quantitative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on exposure data matrices (using a job-exposure matrix) and/or exposure determinants (using an exposure model). Qualatative exposure reconstruction bases exposure estimates on the expert judgement of an industrial hygeinist and self reported exposures.

#### Job-exposure matrices 

Several job-exposure matrices that deal with asbestos have been reported. Pannett et al's 1985 job-exposure matrix for use in population studies in England and Wales[@Pannett1985] found good agreement between job-title assigned categories of exposure (none, low, moderate, high) for asbestos and direct review of the original occupational history by an expert.

Rake et al[@Rake2009] assigned catergories risk of exposure (low, medium, high) using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) can serve as proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation. This approach has been validated in the same cohort by amphibole fibre counts.[@Gilham2015]

DOM-JEM[@Peters2011] was developed for use in population based multi-centre lung cancer case-control study. It assigns job titles one of three categories of asbestos exposure (no exposure, low exposure, high exposure) based on the consensus of three independent expert rators. DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (\kappa = 0.17) but less hetrogenetiy. In a study applying DOM-JEM to the Netherlands Cohort Study (NCS) DOM-JEM showed poor agreement with expert assessment (K = 0.29).[@Offermans2012]  

The Finish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)[@Kauppinen2014] covers exposure to 84 different agents, including asbestos, for 311 jobs across 9 periods spaning 1945-2015. Era-specific estimates of the mean level of asbestos exposure are available for 27 jobs based on expert assessment and measurement data; the exact details of the grounds for estimates are kept in a proprietary FINJEM database which is not freely available. FINJEM showed poor agreement with
expert assessment of asbestos exposure (\kappa = 0.23) but reasonable identification of mesothelioma risk when evaluated using the NCS.[@Offermans2012][@Offermans2014] 

AsbJEM[@Oyen2015] was developed in Australia by an expert panel of three industrial hygeinists using all available exposure data. It is based on FINJEM and provides quantitative estimates of annual exposure for 224 occupations across three time periods spanning 1943 to 2004. It also showed poor agreement with expert assessment of asbestos exposure (\kappa = 0.10)

SYN-JEM[@Peters2016] describes a JEM developed for four carcinogens. It provides quantified asbestos exposure estimates based on 27958 personal measurements (spanning 1971-2009), a mixed effects statistical model, and an a priori categorical assessment of exposure (none, low, high). Cherrie et al[@Cherrie2018] point out that SYN-JEM provides little contrast in the modelled exposure level between categories as the geometric mean for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml and that there are wide variations in regional estimates that are difficult to explain. 

JEMS are generally taken to be superior to direct questions about exposures because they are cheaper, have greater validity, and are less vulnerable to differntial recall. This is because recall of occupations is not influenced by disease status, coding of occupation is blind to case-control status, and translation of codes into exposure is standardized and can not be influence by disease status of a subject.[@Ahrens1993][@Teschke2002][@Gramond2012] 

Orlowski et al[@Orlowski1993] compared two JEMs with a structured job specific questionnaire (SQ) in a lung cancer case-control study. They found that agreement between the JEMs and the SQ was poor (\kappa = 0.23-0.27) and suggested that the sources of error for JEMs were loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and the insuffuciency of published data on occupational asbestos exposure.

#### Exposure modelling approaches

Exposure modelling approaches modify existing measurment data on the basis of knowledge of the determinants of exposure.  
    
A common conceptual framework for this is the source-receptor model (?link a pic) source receptor model[@Tielemans2008][@Smith1991] wherby inhalation exposure is considered in terms of an exposure source, a pathway from source to receptor, and the receptor. The model is then used to propose modifying factors such as activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection.[@Tielemans2008]. 

Exposure modelling approaches make strong intuitive sense; it is known that there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures[@Symanski2006] and, for example, room size and ventillation have been empirically shown to affect the concentration of airborne chemical exposures.[@Cherrie1999a] Further, mathmatical exposure models that take account of known exposure modifying factors to estimate past exposures have shown a good correlation with
measured values.[@Cherrie1999]

A quantified validated historic asbestos exposure model[@Cherrie2018] has recently been developed and proposed as a means of for risk stratifying asbestos exposed workers to optimize mesothelioma screening efforts. The approach has the advantage, compared with job-exposure matrices, of providing a more granular quantified exposure assessment, sensitive to the exposure circumstances of the individual. However, the approach is limited by the fact that the individual must recall that they must recall their exposure circumstances which due to the latency of asbestos related disease may have occurred over 30 years ago. The approach is also limited by the relatively small number of industry-specific data points used for validation, though is unavoidable because of the scarcity of exposure measurement data. 

Exposure modelling approaches to assessing asbestos exposure have research and clinical utility notwithstanding the limitations outlined above together with the requirement that assessors be appropriately trained.  

    
#### Self-reported exposure

Self-reported exposures are a subjects direct report of what they have been exposed to. Typically this is elicited by asking about a specific exposure via questionnaire or interview. 

Most studies comparing self-reported exposures to industrial hygeine measurements have found significant associations but wide variation in the proportions of variance explained by the self reports. This is not surprising given that it is known there is significant within-worker and between-worker variability in occupational exposures. [@Teschke2002][@Symanski2006] 

Two studies comparing self-reported exposures with JEMs found self-reported exposures were more sensitive and of similar or wrose specificity. Self-reported exposures have been shown to be more accurate for easily sensed exposures such as solvents with a strong smell, dusts with larger particle sizes, and vibrations that can be felt.[@Teschke2002]

Several comparative studies have found that self-reporting to have less validity than assessment based on job history, for example using a JEM, or industrial hygenist assessment.

Attribution, specifically the required threshold of asbestos exposure (as assessed by various means) that must be crossed before it is possible to say that, for example, scarring of the lung with an usual interstital pneumonia pattern in an individual patient is caused by asbestos exposure, carries medicolegal in addition to scientific importance has not been well established for several assessment methodolgies.


jems dont take account of variation in job tasks

[@Sahmel2010] point out several important considerations for the use of historical industrial hygeine measurements. Job or tasks for which there was a contempranously exposure concern were more likely to be subject to regulatory exposure control and sampled to demonstrate compliance.
