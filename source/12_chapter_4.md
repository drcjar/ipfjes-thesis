## Introduction

Asbestos related respiratory disease is initiated by inhalation of asbestos fibres. In the UK clinically significant asbestos exposure is largely occupational and, as a result of asbestos control legislation, historic. Occupational exposure can be assessed quantitatively by sampling ambient air at a workplace and calculating a fibre count using microscopy. Alternatively, because asbestos fibres persist in tissues they can also be sampled by lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage. 

Historic workplace measurments are a valuable resource for assessing exposure but are limited in several ways. Measurements are not available for many occupations, where measurements are available they are dependant on working practices and measurment technique at the time of assessment and do not necessarily generalize well. 

Measurement of asbestos fibres in lung tissue by means of biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and not without risk. Additionally the biopersistance of asbestos fibres is variable, counts are sensitive to techniques used, establishing appropriate references ranges can be challenging[@DeVuyst1998]. 

Modern validated quantitative exposure reconstruction methods integrate historic workplace measurements with simulated workplace measurements and an individuals recollection of job processes he or she has carried out during their working life[@Cherrie1999].  

One recent novel approach[@Rake2009] assigned risk of exposure using occupational mortality statistics for pleural mesothelioma. Because pleural mesothelioma in men is nearly entirely attributable to occupational asbestos exposure, pleural mesothelioma is rapidly fatal, and death certificates record occupation in addition to cause of death, the proportional mortality ratio for pleural mesothelioma (number of deaths due to pleural mesothelioma/total number of deaths) is a good proxy for average asbestos exposure in a particular occupation.
