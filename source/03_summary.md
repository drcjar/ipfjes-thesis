<!-- This is the abstract -->

The question of whether occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognized cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises because it is clinically plausible, epidemiologically plausible, and consistent with fibre studies and case-control data. This thesis examines the question by means of a literature review and a novel hospital based case-control study, the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).
