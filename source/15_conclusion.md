## Thesis summary

This thesis presents the findings of an analysis of UK mortality trends for IPF and asbestos related disease, a review of previous occupational case-control studies of IPF that have investigated occupational exposures in IPF, a review of historic asbestos exposure assessment methods, a review of the IPF genetic susceptibility factor MUC5b promotor region SNP rs35705950, and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).

IPF mortality and asbestos related disease are strongly, if ecologically, correlated and there are several prima facae reasons to suppose that occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognised cause of IPF, namely: it is more common in men and manual workers, it has been associated with occupational metal, wood, and stone dust exposures in several previous studies, and heavy asbestos fibre burdens have been identified in the lung tissue of IPF patients in a small case series. 

Historic asbestos exposure assessment is challenging because of a paucity of historic data and variable biopersistence and invitro modification of asbestos fibres. Among the best current validated means are assessment based on job title and the use of known job title related pleural mesothelioma risk as a proxy, and historic exposure reconstruction using source receptor models that provide validated estimates of cumulative asbestos exposure.

The MUC5b promotor region SNP rs357950 is the strongest identified risk factor for IPF. It is associated with higher levels of distal airway MUC5b and is thought to mediate disease by reduced airway clearance and through interaction with airway microbiota.  

IPFJES, a large multicentre hospital based case-control study of occupational exposures in IPF, demonstrates that the majority of men in the UK have at least one high or medium risk for asbestos exposure job during their lifetime and about 8% have heavy (>25 fibre-ml.year) asbestos exposure, that this is not significantly associated with IPF risk, and that this association is not modified by rs357950 genotype. IPFJES finds a significant association between occupational asbestos exposure and dyspnoea which is independent of case and smoking status.

## Future work

Planned future work includes further study of non-asbestos occupational exposures in IPF, augmentation of the study data with pulmonary function test measurements, a mendelian randomisation study of smoking in IPF, and antibody characterisation of serum collected from participants with a view to investigating the possibility of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis IPF misclassification.
