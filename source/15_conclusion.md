## Thesis summary

This thesis presents the findings of an analysis of UK mortality trends for IPF and asbestos related disease, a review of previous occupational case-control studies of IPF that have investigated occupational exposures in IPF, a review of historic asbestos exposure assessment methods, a review of the IPF genetic susceptibility factor MUC5b promoter region SNP rs35705950, and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES).

IPF mortality and asbestos related disease are strongly, if ecologically, correlated and there are several *prima faciae* reasons to suppose that occupational asbestos exposure is an under-recognised cause of IPF, namely: it is more common in men and manual workers, it has been associated with occupational metal, wood, and stone dust exposures in several previous studies, and heavy asbestos fibre burdens have been identified in the lung tissue of IPF patients in a small case series. 

Historic asbestos exposure assessment is challenging because of a paucity of historic data and variable biopersistence and in vitro modification of asbestos fibres. Among the best current validated means are assessment based on job title and the use of known job title related pleural mesothelioma risk as a proxy, and historic exposure reconstruction using source receptor models that provide validated estimates of cumulative asbestos exposure.

The MUC5b promoter region SNP rs357950 is the strongest identified risk factor for IPF. It is associated with higher levels of distal airway MUC5b and is thought to mediate disease by reduced airway clearance and through interaction with airway microbiota.  

IPFJES, a large multicentre hospital based case-control study of occupational exposures in IPF, demonstrates that the majority of men in the UK have at least one high or medium risk for asbestos exposure job during their lifetime and about 8% have heavy (\ensuremath{>}25 fibre-ml.year) asbestos exposure, that this is not significantly associated with IPF risk, and that this association is not modified by rs357950 genotype. IPFJES finds a significant association between occupational asbestos exposure and dyspnoea which is independent of case and smoking status. IPFJES finds a significant interaction between occupational asbestos exposure and smoking which increases risk of IPF, is more marked in patients with definite UIP, and appears to require a minor allele of the MUC5b promoter variant rs357950. 

## Future work

I plan to investigate my current hypothesis that occupational asbestos and respirable crystalline silica induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes IPF via IL-1\ensuremath{\beta} stimulated MUC5b hypersecretion in smokers. I will do this by assessing silica exposure in IPFJES through well validated quantitative means and genotyping the IPFJES cohort for SNPs in the NLRP3 inflammasome associated with enhanced enhanced IL-1\ensuremath{\beta} release. I will also carry out two-sample mendelian randomisation studies of risk factors in IPF (to isolate the NLRP3 inflammasome) including smoking, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, iron status, and cytokine profiles in IPF using existing IPF GWAS data and exposure GWAS data.[@Allen2019][@Wootton2019][@An2019][@Gill2019][@Georgakis2019]
