# Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES): Is occupational asbestos exposure an under-recognised cause of IPF?

## Introduction

Occult occupational asbestos exposure as a cause for otherwise 'idiopathic' pulmonary fibrosis has been an open question for at least 30 years. The question arises because of the clinical and radiological similarities of asbestosis and IPF; a usual interstitial pneumonia is observed in both, and patients can present in the same way. (chapter 1) Patients having significant asbestos exposure, that would warrant a diagnosis of asbestosis, may go undetected because they do not recall exposure or because where they do recall exposure it is difficult to assess if the exposure is sufficient to have caused disease.(chapter 4) A recent meta-analysis of IPF case control studies reporting on occupational exposures found significant associations between metal, wood, and stone dust, and IPF.(chapter 2) However, the extent of confounding by groups of workers likely to have significant asbestos co-exposure, for example carpenters and metal plate workers is unknown. The majority of these studies are limited by their reliance on self-reported binary exposure which risks recall bias and does not permit investigation of dose-response relationships which would be helpful for establishing causality. Studies to date have also not looked at the possibility of gene-environment interaction; genetic risk factors such as rs5270590 are now well established and interaction with inhaled exposures is suspected but has not yet proven in humans (chapter 5). The question of asbestos exposure in IPF is a live one globally because countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, continue to consume asbestos and, closer to home, asbestos related and IPF mortality rates are rising; asbestos related mortality is driven primarily by pleural mesothelioma and is expected to peak in the next couple of years as a result of effective asbestos exposure control legislation, the rise in IPF mortality rates is unexplained.(chapter 3) 

IPFJES is a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study conceived to definitively address the question of asbestos exposure having a causal role in IPF. Participants were recruited from a network of 21 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Cases were men who presented, between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019, with a new MDT diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria.[@Raghu2011] Controls were men who attended selected outpatient clinics in the same time period. An outpatient clinic was randomly selected to be the source clinic for the recruitment of controls at each hospital from a list of all outpatient clinics (not confined to respiratory) local research teams could recruit from. Over 460 cases and 460 controls, frequency-matched on age, were recruited to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants.[clinicaltrials.gov NCT03211507] Participants were interviewed by telephone by a trained interviewer who was blind to their case status using a bespoke study web application (ipfjes-interview). Lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history, and MRC dyspnoea score were recorded. Using ipfjes-interview each occupation was coded on the basis of the Office for national statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90) at the time of the interview. For participants who recalled carrying out work tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded. SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fibre-ml/year estimate was calculated for participants recalling asbesots exposure. All participants provided an EDTA sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF sucepticbility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950 using Q-PCR and a Taqman assay. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. In a secondary analysis we used logistic regression to invest6igate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occ upational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions.

## Method

### Funding, approvals, and registration 
We obtained funding from welcome trust (201291/Z/16/Z) and ethical approval (IRAS project ID 203355, REC reference 17/EM/0021). We also obtained NIHR portfolio status (CPMS ID 203355) and registered our study on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03211507). 

### Selection
Cases were men of any age who were diagnosed with IPF at 21 collaborating hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. The diagnosis of IPF by the referring centres was made at MDT on the basis of clinical history, high-resolution computed-tomography (HRCT), and where necessary lung biopsy in accordance with standard criteria.[@Raghu2011] Referring centres provided HRCT report findings for all cases and histopathology report findings for 9 cases and the central research interview asked directly about presenting symptoms at telephone interview. 

At each collaborating hospital an outpatient clinic was randomly selected to be the source clinic for the recruitment of controls from a list of all outpatient clinics (not confined to respiratory) that the local research team could recruit. If the clinic selected was unsuitable, for example because it did not contain men of a similar age to cases or the clinic lead declined to participate then this was recorded and a further random selection made. Controls were men that attended the selected outpatient clinics between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. Controls were frequency-matched on age, were recruited to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants.

Men who were unable give informed consent or who had worked outside of the UK for one year or more (not including work outside the UK by member of the armed forces or merchant navy) were excluded from being cases and controls. Cases and controls were approached by local research teams and provided with the IPFJES participant information sheet. They were given opportunity to read it and ask questions and then invited to sign the consent form and provide their contact details and a blood sample if they wished to take part. Local researchers completed a case report form detailing participant demographic information, CT and biopsy results, and contact details which was sent together with the blood sample by secure post to the central research team. 22 of 496 cases(4\%), and 45 of 463 controls(9\%) were withdrawn because they no longer wished to take part in the study, they did not respond after we called them on three occasions, or we were notified that they had died before the interview took place.

### Measures
A trained interviewer (RS or CR) who was blind to the case status of participants conducted the study interviews by telephone. Interviews were recorded for quality control purposes. The interviewer used a bespoke web application, called ipfjes-interview, to adminster a structured interview collecting information on lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history, MRC dyspnoea score, and presenting symptoms. For each job information was collected on the job title, job tasks, employer, start and stop year of employment, and whether employment was full-time (>=35 hour per week) or part time. Smoking history was recorded as start and stop year of smoking, number of cigarettes (or equivilant using https://www.smokingpackyears.com/) per day, and what was smoked - cigarettes/roll-ups/pipe/other. Participants were asked about prior exposure nine drugs suspected of causing usual interstitial pneumonia (amiodarone, azathioprine, bleomycin, flecainide, gefitinib, ifosamide, melphalan, and nitrofurantoin).[@Bonniaud2014] Using the job title and ipfjes-interview each occupation was coded in real time to the office for national statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90). SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma[@HSE2009].For participants who recalled carrying out work tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded.  A fibre-ml/year estimate was calculated using a model with parameters for the type of asbestos used (substance emission potential, E), what was done with it (activity emission potential, H), how well ventilated the room the activity was carried out in was (general ventilation parameters, D), and whether there were any local exposure controls, for example wetting (local controls, LC). The calculation to estimate asbestos exposure (AE) for a given asbestos related task was: AE = E * H * LC. AE for each task was then weighted according to the amount total of time spent performing the task arrive at a task fibre-ml/year exposure estimate. Task fibre-ml/year exposure estimates were then summed at an individual participant level to provide an overall fibre-ml/year estimate. A random sample of high (top 25% of values), medium (25-75% centile), and low (bottom 25% of values) estimates was checked by a hygeine assessment expert who was blind to participant case status (JC).[@Cherrie1999][@Cherrie2018]

 All participants provided an EDTA sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF sucepticbility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950. DNA was extracted using a nucleon dna extaction kit (protocol). Genotypes of the MUC5B SNP rs35705950 were determined using TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions were performed in 384-well plates, and fluorescence was read using an Applied Biosystems Viia7 Sequence Detection System (protocol).


### Statistical analysis
Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. In a secondary analysis we used logistic regression to investigate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occ upational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions. Sensitivity analysis of distance to centre was also performed because we expected cases to live further away from the hospital that controls on average (as IPF care is centralised to a select number of specialist centres) and we hypothesised that distance from the hospital might be associated with liklihood of exposure to asbestos.
