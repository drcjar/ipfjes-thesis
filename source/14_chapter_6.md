# Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES): Is occupational asbestos exposure an under-recognised cause of IPF?

## Introduction

Occult occupational asbestos exposure as a cause for otherwise 'idiopathic' pulmonary fibrosis has been an open question for at least 30 years. The question arises because of the clinical and radiological similarities of asbestosis and IPF; a usual interstitial pneumonia is observed in both, and patients can present in the same way (chapter 1). Patients having significant asbestos exposure, that would warrant a diagnosis of asbestosis, may go undetected because they do not recall exposure or because where they do recall exposure it is difficult to assess if the exposure is sufficient to have caused disease (chapter 4). A recent meta-analysis of IPF case control studies reporting on occupational exposures found significant associations between metal, wood, and stone dust, and IPF (chapter 2). However, the extent of confounding by groups of workers likely to have significant asbestos co-exposure, for example carpenters and metal plate workers, is unknown. The majority of these studies are limited by their reliance on self-reported binary exposure which risks recall bias and does not permit investigation of dose-response relationships which would be helpful for establishing causality. Studies to date have also not looked at the possibility of gene-environment interaction; genetic risk factors such as rs5270590 are now well established and interaction with inhaled exposures is suspected but has not yet proven in humans (chapter 5). The question of asbestos exposure in IPF is a live one globally because countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, continue to consume asbestos and, closer to home, asbestos related and IPF mortality rates continue to rise; asbestos related mortality in the UK is driven primarily by pleural mesothelioma and is expected to peak in the next couple of years as a result of effective asbestos exposure control legislation, the sustained rise in IPF mortality rates is unexplained (chapter 3).

IPFJES is a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study conceived to definitively address the question of asbestos exposure having a causal role in IPF. Participants were recruited from a network of 21 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Cases were men who presented, between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019, with a new MDT diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria.[@Raghu2011] Controls were men who attended selected outpatient clinics in the same time period. An outpatient clinic was randomly selected to be the source clinic for the recruitment of controls at each hospital from a list of all outpatient clinics (not confined to respiratory) local research teams could recruit from. Over 460 cases and 460 controls, frequency-matched on age, were recruited to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants.[clinicaltrials.gov NCT03211507] Participants were interviewed by telephone by a trained interviewer who was blind to their case status using a bespoke study web application (ipfjes-interview, full source code available at www.ipfjes.org). Lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score were recorded. Using ipfjes-interview each occupation was coded on the basis of the Office for national statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90) at the time of the interview. For participants who recalled carrying out work tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded. SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fibre-ml.year estimate was calculated for participants recalling asbestos exposure. All participants provided an EDTA sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF susceptibility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950 using Q-PCR and a Taqman assay. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. In a secondary analysis we used logistic regression to investigate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occupational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions.

## Method

### Funding, approvals, and registration 
We obtained funding from welcome trust (201291/Z/16/Z) and ethical approval (IRAS project ID 203355, REC reference 17/EM/0021). We also obtained NIHR portfolio status (CPMS ID 203355) and registered our study on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03211507). Full study documentation is available online at www.ipfjes.org. 

### Selection
Initially 15 hospitals were invited to collaborate as recruiting centres for IPFJES. Centres were selected on the basis of us having a known contact there, the centre having an IPF MDT, geographic dispersion, and  confirmation that the centre could recruit 40 cases and 40 controls over two years. Six additional centres were added to ensure the study wide recruitment target was achieved when it became apparent that only seven of the original 15 recruiting centres would meet their agreed target.  

Cases were men of any age who were diagnosed with IPF at 21 collaborating hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. The diagnosis of IPF by the referring centres was made at MDT on the basis of clinical history, high-resolution computed-tomography (HRCT), and where necessary lung biopsy in accordance with standard criteria.[@Raghu2011] Referring centres provided HRCT report findings for all cases and histopathology report findings for cases where a biopsy was performed. 

At each collaborating hospital an outpatient clinic was randomly selected to be the source clinic for the recruitment of controls from a list of all outpatient clinics (not confined to respiratory) that the local research team could recruit. If the clinic selected was unsuitable, for example because it did not contain men of a similar age to cases or the clinic lead declined to participate then this was recorded and a further random selection made. Controls were men that attended the selected outpatient clinics between 01/02/2017 and 01/10/2019. Controls were frequency-matched on age, were recruited to achieve a pre-defined recruitment target of 920 participants.

Men who were unable to give informed consent or who had worked outside of the UK for one year or more (not including work outside the UK by a member of the armed forces or merchant navy) were excluded from being cases and controls. Cases and controls were approached by local research teams and provided with the IPFJES participant information sheet. They were given opportunity to read it and ask questions and then invited to sign the consent form and provide their contact details and a blood sample if they wished to take part. Local researchers completed a case report form detailing participant demographic information, CT and biopsy results, and contact details which was sent together with the blood sample by secure post to the central research team. 

### Measures
A trained interviewer (RS or CR) who was blind to the case status of participants conducted the study interviews by telephone. Interviews were recorded for quality control purposes. The interviewer used a bespoke web application, called ipfjes-interview, to administer a structured interview collecting information on lifetime occupational history, smoking history, drug history, family history, mMRC dyspnoea score, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. For each job information was collected on the job title, job tasks, employer, start and stop year of employment, and whether employment was full-time (>=35 hour per week) or part time. Smoking history was recorded as start and stop year of smoking, number of cigarettes (or equivalent using https://www.smokingpackyears.com/) per day, and what was smoked - cigarettes/roll-ups/pipe/other. Participants were asked about prior exposure to nine drugs suspected of causing usual interstitial pneumonia (amiodarone, azathioprine, bleomycin, flecainide, gefitinib, ifosamide, melphalan, and nitrofurantoin).[@Bonniaud2014] Using the job title and ipfjes-interview each occupation was coded in real time to the office for national statistics (ONS) standardised occupational classification 1990 (SOC90).

SOC90 coded jobs were used to assign asbestos exposure risk to participants using occupational proportional mortality rates for malignant pleural mesothelioma[@Peto2009]. For participants who recalled carrying out work tasks with asbestos a detailed assessment of each work task was recorded. A fibre-ml/year estimate was calculated using a model with parameters for the type of asbestos used (substance emission potential, E), what was done with it (activity emission potential, H), how well ventilated the room the activity was carried out in was (general ventilation parameters, D), and whether there were any local exposure controls, for example wetting (local controls, LC). The calculation to estimate asbestos exposure (AE) for a given asbestos related task was: AE = E * H * LC. AE for each task was then weighted according to the amount total of time spent performing the task arrive at a task fibre-ml/year exposure estimate. Task fibre-ml/year exposure estimates were then summed at an individual participant level to provide an overall fibre-ml/year estimate. A random sample of high (top 25% of values), medium (25-75% centile), and low (bottom 25% of values) estimates was checked by a hygiene assessment expert who was blind to participant case status (JC).[@Cherrie1999][@Cherrie2018]

SOC90 coded jobs were also used to assign National Statistics Socio-economic analytic classes (NS-SEC). The Office of National Statistics provides a lookup to assign each SOC90 code to one of eight classes:

1. Higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations. 1.1 Large employers and higher managerial and administrative occupations. 1.2 Higher professional occupations. 
2. Lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations
3. Intermediate occupations
4. Small employers and own account workers
5. Lower supervisory and technical occupations
6. Semi-routine occupations
7. Routine occupations
8. Never worked and long-term unemployed

We then assigned each individual to a single code by calculating the median code for all of the jobs they had held. 

Participants were classified as occupationally exposed to stone, wood, and metal dust or not (binary measure) on the basis of the recorded participant provided description of tasks carried out within a job including the words 'stone' (or 'silica'), 'wood', or 'metal', respectively. 

All participants provided an EDTA sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped according to IPF susceptibility single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs35705950. DNA was extracted using a nucleon dna extraction kit (protocol). Genotypes of the MUC5B SNP rs35705950 were determined using TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions were performed in 96-well plates, and fluorescence was read using an Applied Biosystems Viia7 Sequence Detection System.


### Statistical analysis
Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age, smoking status and recruiting centre as part of a prespecified analysis (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03211507). 

In a planned secondary analysis we investigated for possibile interaction between asbestos exposure and rs35705950 genotype.

In unplanned secondary analysis we used logistic regression to investigate metal, wood, and stone dust exposure (self-reported occupational exposure), and rs35705950 genotype-exposure interactions. Sensitivity analysis of distance to centre was also performed because we expected cases to live further away from the hospital that controls on average (as IPF care is centralised to a select number of specialist centres) and we hypothesised that distance from the hospital might be associated with
likelihood of exposure to asbestos. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to investigate associations between individual variables, such as distance from hospital and fibre-ml.year asbestos exposure estimates. We used ordinal logistic regression to investigate the relationship between mMRC dyspnoea score and measures of asbestos exposure. 

In the course of this work I learned that the minor allele of rs35705950 was associated with asbestosis[@Platenburg2020], that smoking and asbestos exposure interact significantly in asbestosis[@Mossman1998], and that this interaction is likely to be mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation[@Dostert2008]; a process which results in increased MUC5b expression. This led me to hypothesise that there may be an interaction between rs35705950, asbestos, and smoking. To test this hypothesis I stratified by genotype and investigated interaction between smoking and occupational asbestos exposure using unconditional logistic regression.

## Results

516 cases and 511 controls were recruited to IPFJES in the study period Feb 2017 to October 2019. 22 of 516 cases(4\%), and 45 of 511 controls(9\%) were withdrawn because they no longer wished to take part in the study, they did not respond after we called them on three occasions, or we were notified that they had died before the interview took place. The remaining 960 participants (494 cases, 466 controls) comprise the study sample. 

The median year of birth and age was 1943 and 76 for cases and 1945 and 74 for controls. Most cases and controls reported their ethnicity as white (97% and 96% respectively). Social economic class and exposure to smoking were similar for cases and controls (see Table one).

All cases had a CT thorax and this was reported as definite UIP in 266 (54%) cases, possible UIP in 216 (44%) cases, or other 12 (2%) cases. Nine cases (2%) had a biopsy because the CT was thorax was non-diagnostic, all of these were reported as define UIP. Cases were more breathless than controls as measured by the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale and known rs3570950 IPF associations were evident (see Table two).

Randomly-selected control clinics for recruiting centres are shown in Table three. Where more than one clinic is shown this indicates that the random selection process was repeated because of difficulty recruiting adequate numbers of participants (defined as four attendances to the control clinic by the local research team and fewer than four participants recruited).

^2^ Controls were under-recruited because of local research staffing shortage.

330 (67%) cases and 295 (63%) controls ever had a high or medium asbestos exposure risk job, defined on the basis of proportional occupational mortality statistics.[@Peto2009] Ever having a high or medium asbestos exposure risk job was not associated with IPF (see Table four).

A total of 463 asbestos exposed job tasks were recalled in sufficient detail to permit a fibre-ml.year estimate of exposure by 233 individual participants. 125 (25%) of cases and 108 (23%) of controls recalled occupational asbestos exposure in sufficient detail to permit estimation of cumulative fibre-ml.year exposure. 41 (33%) of cases and 35 (32%) of controls which equated to approximately 8% of the total number of cases and 8% of the total number of controls, had cumulative estimates exceeding 25 asbestos fibre-ml.years (see Table six).

Fibre-ml.year exposure assessments showed reasonable correlation on the log-scale, but not the linear scale, with an independent assessor (JC) for a validation sample of low, medium, and high exposure assessments, R^2^ = 0.63 (see Figure 6.2). 

![Independent validation of fibre-ml.year exposure assessments](source/figures/cherrie_validation.png){ width=50% }

108(23%) of 463 asbestos exposed job task fibre-ml.year estimates were in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years. 81(75%) occurred in jobs classified as high risk or medium risk; 17(15%) occurred in high-risk non-construction jobs e.g boiler lagger, 54(50%) in high-risk construction jobs such as carpenter, electrician, and plumber, and 10 (9%) in medium risk industrial jobs such as machinist or fitter. Carpenter was the single most common job title accounting for 6(5%) of estimates in excess of 25
fibre-ml.years (see Figures 6.3 and 6.4).

818(85%) of the 960 participants were genotyped for MUC5b rs3570950. Being heterozygous for the disease associated variant (GT) had an odds ratio of 5 (95%CI 3.7-6.8; p < 0.001) for disease. Being homozygous for the disease associated variant (GG) had an odds ratio of 13.3 (95%CI 5.1-35, p < 0.001) for disease. Ever having smoked was associated with increased risk of disease, odds ratio 1.4 (95%CI 1-1.8, p < 0.03). There was a statistically significant interaction between smoking and
having ever been been exposed to a high or medium asbestos exposure risk job, odds ratio for interaction 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p < 0.04). Several non-significant gene-environment interactions were present (see Table seven).

As a result of increasing awareness, and regulation, occupational asbestos exposure prior to 1980 was significantly more widespread.[@Gilham2018] To investigate whether occupational asbestos exposure might be associated with IPF during this period I performed a sensitivity analysis by only including participants jobs that ended before 1980. I did not observe a significant association (Table nine and ten). I also performed sensitivity analyses limiting to jobs that started before 1980, participants born prior to 65, and considering only jobs before age 45[@Darnton2012]; there was no significant association between asbestos exposure and IPF for these.

![Years in a medium or high risk asbestos exposure job for cases and controls (N=492)](source/figures/years.png)

Cases and controls lived an average of 28km and 16km respectively from their recruiting hospital, measured by calculating the distance between the postcode centroid of the participants general practice and the postcode centroid of the hospital. Living further away from the hospital correlated with being a case, r=0.22, 95%CI = 0.16-0.29, p < 0.001 and weakly correlated with reduced asbestos exposure, r=-0.06, 95%CI = -0.13-0, p=0.05. To investigate this further I performed a sensitivity analysis limited to participants within 10km of their recruiting hospital (Table thirteen and fourteen).

To investigate cumulative 'dose' of exposure based on job title a score was assigned based on asbestos exposure risk category of each job as follows:

- high-risk non-construction : 2
- high-risk construction : 2
- medium risk industrial : 1
- low risk industrial : 0
- office : 0

Scores were then multiplied for each job by the duration in years of the job and then summed at participant level. See Table fifteen and Figure 6.7.

310 (63%) of IPF cases initially presented to their doctor with cough and 306 (62%) with breathlessness (91 patients presented with cough and breathlessness). 15 (3%) of cases and 42 (9%) of controls reported ever taking a medication suspected of causing usual interstitial pneumonia (amiodarone, azathioprine, bleomycin, flecainide, gefitinib, ifosamide, melphalan, and nitrofurantoin).[@Bonniaud2014] 

414 (83%) of cases and 441 (95%) of controls reported one or more comorbidities. The most commonly reported comorbidities (occurring in at least 10 cases or controls) occurred at a similar frequency in cases and controls and included hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, osteoarthritis, and prostate cancer. Rheumatoid arthritis was reported in 18 cases, approximately 2% of cases reporting a comorbidity, and in 9 controls, approximately 1% of controls reporting a comorbidity. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) was reported in 14 cases, approximately 1.5% of cases reporting a comorbidity, and in 2 controls, approximately 0.5% of controls reporting a comorbidity.  

Dyspnoea, as measured by the mMRC dyspnoea scale was associated with case-status, smoking status, genotype, and asbestos exposure. Pearson's correlation coefficient for IPF was 0.49 (95%CI 0.44-0.53, p<0.001), ever smoking was 0.16 (95%CI 0.09-0.23, p<0.001), pack-year smoked was 0.2 (95%CI 0.13-0.26, p<0.001), genotype 0.2 (95%CI 0.13-0.27, p<0.001), ever held a medium or high risk asbestos exposure job title 0.09 (95%CI 0.02-0.16, p=0.02), and 0.15 (95%CI 0.08-0.21, p<0.001) for having a fibre-ml.year estimate > 25.

## Discussion

### findings, interpretation, implications, relations ot others work, limitations, strengths

494 cases and 466 controls were recruited and interviewed. The median age of cases was 76 years and controls 74 years. 97% of cases and 96% of controls reported their ethnicity as white and social economic class and exposure to smoking were similar for cases and controls (see Table 1). Cases were less likely than controls to have ever been prescribed medications known to cause UIP, 15(3%) versus 42(9%) respectively. Cases were more likely than controls to be breathless, Pearson's correlation
coefficient for mMRC dyspnoea and case status was 0.49 (95%CI 0.44-0.53, p<0.001), adjusted OR for was 6.8 (95%CI 5.25-8.8; p<0.001). Cases were also more likely to have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease than controls, 14(2%) versus 2(0.5%), a known association.[@Raghu2006a] After controlling for case and smoking status ever a high or medium risk job for asbestos exposure was associated with dyspnoea, measured using ordinal logistic regression and mMRC dyspnoea score, OR 1.44(1.12-1.84; p=0.004). The strength of association between asbestos exposure and dyspnoea increased with increasing categories of asbestos exposure risk.

Ever being exposed to an occupation at high or medium risk for asbestos exposure was common for both cases (67%) and controls (63%) and the difference in the proportion exposed between cases and controls was not significant (Table four). A similar pattern was observed for categories of exposure (Table five). 8% of cases and controls had estimated cumulative asbestos fibre-ml.year exposures in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years, the Helsinki criteria exposure threshold at which cases of asbestosis may
occur.[@Wolff2015] The majority of these participants had high or medium risk occupations as defined by job title with carpenter being the single most common job title accounting for 5% of all estimates in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years. In an unplanned secondary analysis we also found a significant association self reported occupational exposure to stone dust and IPF, OR 2.9(1.3-6.7; 0.01). 

In common with numerous previous studies we found MUC5b rs3570950 to be strongly associated with disease in a risk allele dose-dependant fashion. We found no evidence of interaction between asbestos exposure and MUC5b rs3570950. However, we did find a significant association for having ever smoked, OR 1.4 (95%CI 1-1.8, p < 0.03) and for having ever smoked and having ever had a high or medium asbestos exposure risk based on job title, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p < 0.04). 
Sensitivity analyses including limiting jobs considered to only those that ended before 1980, considering only jobs with a duration greater than 5 years, considering only participants living within 10km of their recruiting hospital, and considering cumulative exposure 'dose' based on summing years in different asbestos exposure risk categories (assigned by job title) at participant level, were all non-significant. 

Cases and controls were well matched and there was no significant association between asbestos exposure, measured by well validated means by job title or by historic asbestos exposure reconstruction, and IPF. There are three main possible explanations for this:

1. Asbestos exposure is not an important cause of IPF
2. Asbestos exposure is only an important cause in concert with other environmental or genetic exposures
3. Asbestos exposure has not been measured accurately enough in IPFJES

8% of cases apparently meet the Helsinki criteria for a diagnosis of asbestosis.[@Wolff2015] This criterion has been criticised for failing to reflect the linear dose-response relationship, and lack of threshold, observed in the published literature.[@Stayner1997][@Hein2007][@Baur2016] Strictly, IPF is a diagnosis of exclusion that should not be made until exposures to asbestos, and other known causes of fibrosis, have been excluded.[@Raghu2011][@Baur2016] Taken to its logical conclusion this line of argument may result in no diagnoses of IPF in the UK since asbestos exposure is ubiquitous; the average asbestos lung burden in men and women without occupational asbestos exposure was recently measured at approximately 1 fibre/mg of lung tissue.[@Gilham2018] In IPFJES the population attributable fraction (PAF) calculated using the adjusted, non-significant, odds ratio (OR) for ever exposed and proportion of cases ever exposed (pc) and the equation: PAF = pc(OR − 1)/OR[@Blanc2019] is about 5%. 

Of note asbestosis is not necessarily fatal[@Doll1985] and may not even be symptomatic since diagnostic criteria require evidence of scarring of the lungs and evidence of asbestos exposure but not the presence of symptoms.[@Wolff2015] In this context a cut off below which exposure is unlikely to cause significant morbidity or mortality seems reasonable. Intriguingly, our results support the concept of asbestos exposure being associated with dyspnoea independent of having IPF and smoking.

In epidemiological studies the death rate from asbestosis and prevalence of signs and symptoms to it are both higher in cigarette smokers than non-smokers.[@Doll1985] In mouse studies cigarette smoke and asbestos exposure increase the production of reactive oxygen species that are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of asbestosis.[@Liu2013] Asbestos fibres activates NLRP3 inflammasome.[@Morris2015] This is compatible with our observation of an interaction between asbestos exposure, as measured by ever having a job at medium or high risk for asbestos exposure, and ever having smoked on IPF risk, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p=0.04). 

I found evidence supporting an interaction between ever smoking and ever having a high or medium risk asbestos exposure job, OR 4.6 (95%CI 1.5-14, p=0.01) when stratifying for genotype, see Table nineteen. It is known that the minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant, the strongest IPF risk factor, is associated with markedly increased MUC5b expression and that MUC5b is a dominant constituent of the honeycomb cysts that characterise IPF.[@Seibold2013] It is also known
that asbestos exposure activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and results in increased IL-1beta release (as does smoking), and IL-1beta release is a potent stimulus for increased MUC5b expression.[@Dostert2008][@Mossman1998][@Fujisawa2011][@Kuschner1996] This would add to the accumulating evidence for a MUC5b driven pulmonary fibrosis endotype.

There is a precedent for the importance of genetic susceptibility in the development of disease in response to asbestiform fibre inhalation; specifically germline BAP1 mutations were discovered to be important together with eronite exposure in the Cappodecia mesothelioma epidemic.[@Testa2011][@Emri2017] It is possible that there unmeasured genetic modifiers of asbestos exposure risk the presence, or absence, of which is necessary for the development of disease. 

Despite best efforts it is still theoretically possible that my asbestos exposure measure was insufficiently sensitive. Review of all occupational histories by a trained occupational hygeinist blind to the case status of participants would have been desirable but was was prohibitively expensive. It is also possible that the underlying data on which to base historic assessments is not detailed enough to permit sufficiently sensitive assessments by any means.   

Asbestosis can have a latency of upwards of 40 years[@Harding2010] and rates have not yet peaked in the UK.[@HSE2019] From 1900 until around 1960 (see Figure 6.8), when asbestos consumption in the United Kingdom peaked, the United Kingdom had the third highest per capita asbestos consumption in the world with only to the United States and later Australia having higher rates of consumption.[@Allen2017] Our results are likely to generalize well globally where,  with the exception of Brasil, Russian, India, Iran, and China which continue to consume asbestos, consumption has been lower and peaked later.    

![Global asbestos consumption per capita 1920-2013](source/figures/asbestos_consumption.png){ width=50% }

The main strengths of our study include its size, use of hospital controls, high participation rates and avoidance of non-response bias, the use of two independent validated asbestos exposure assessment instruments, and the assessment of gene-environment interaction. Additionally assessors in IPFJES were blind to case status throughout and the study design and pre-specified outcomes were recorded on clincialtrial.gov (NCT03211507). 

## Conclusion

The majority of men in their 70s in the UK who attend hospital have held a high or medium risk for asbestos exposure job during their working lifetime; estimated asbestos exposure based on validated means inferred by job title or historic asbestos exposure reconstruction methods does not significantly affect risk of IPF. Nonetheless, about 8% of IPF cases have a history of heavy occupational asbestos exposure (>25 fibre-ml.years) that would support a diagnosis of asbestosis based on the Helsinki criteria. 

Asbestos exposure alone does not appear to be an important cause of IPF. It remains possible that it is important in concert with other, unmeasured, environmental or genetic risk factors, and is associated with dyspnoea in our study.
