# Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES): Is occupational asbestos exposure an under-regcognised cause of IPF?

## Introduction

My study will be a multi-centre, hospital-outpatient, incident case-control study. Participants will be recruited from a UK network of six confirmed centres. Cases will be men who present, between 07.2017 and 07.2019, with a new diagnosis of IPF consistent with standard criteria[@Raghu2011]; they will be identified monthly by the MDT coordinator of participating centres.[@NICE2013]

For each case, four controls, frequency-matched on age, will be randomly selected from incident outpatient attendances (not confined to respiratory) who do not have a diagnosis of IPF and are from the hospital as the case. Monthly lists of outpatient attendances will be obtained using the patient administration systems of participating centres. 120 cases and 480 controls will be recruited over two years with four participants enrolled and interviewed per day. 

Eligible participants will be contacted by telephone and invited to participate. An interviewer will collect data on demographics, lifetime occupational history, hobbies, family medical history, and smoking using a structured web-based questionnaire designed by us to collect lifetime occupational histories. This approach will facilitate coding, allow input validation, and permit questions to be tailored to pre-specified conditions. The questions will be developed in collaboration with an international expert in asbestos exposure measurement, Dr John Cherrie of the IOM. Participants will be invited to provide a venous blood sample for genetic analysis. 

Cases and controls will be genotyped using a panel of 15 pre-defined candidate susceptibility SNPs including rs35705950. Genotyping will be undertaken using Q-PCR and Taqman assays on DNA isolated from whole blood samples.

For the primary analysis unconditional logistic regression will be used to analyse 'any' vs 'no' asbestos exposure and categories of cumulative exposure adjusting for age and smoking status. Prior data[@Rake2009] indicate that the probability of exposure among controls is 0.29.  If the true OR for disease in exposed subjects relative to unexposed subjects is 2.0, I will need to recruit 94 case patients and 376 control patients to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this odds ratio equals 1 with \ensuremath{\beta = 0.2} and \ensuremath{\alpha = 0.05}[@Dupont1990]; my planned sample size sample size includes a margin for model stability and incomplete data.[@Agresti2007]

Secondary (exploratory) analysis will investigate gene-environment interaction. The global minor allele frequency of MUC5B rs35705950 is 0.05.[@Cariaso2012] With an estimated prevalence of IPF of 20/100000[@Navaratnam2011] and with ORs 2.0 for asbestos exposure and 6.8 for rs35705950[@Seibold2011], 113 cases would be required to detect a minimum interaction OR of 4.0.[@Gauderman2002] While I acknowledge that this exploratory analysis will have the power to detect only a large effect size it seems a valuable opportunity to examine an unexplored area in IPF research.
