Mortality from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in England and Wales by birth cohor

Introduction and objectives: The incidence of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been increasing at a rate of 5% per annum since 2000.  By definition, the diagnosis of IPF is not made in the presence of an identifiable cause. However, the distribution of the disease in the population (more common in men, manual workers, and those living in more industrial areas of the country) suggests a causal contribution from an occupational or environmental source. This would be expected to produce a cohort effect.  Our aim was to examine trends in IPF mortality data for evidence of such an effect.

Methods: Age and sex stratified mortality data for IPF were obtained for England and Wales from the Office of National Statistics for the period 1974–2012. Data were age-standardised and visualised using the Python Pandas data analysis library and matplotlib.

Results: There is evidence of a cohort effect with age-specific IPF death rates increasing in successive cohorts, most clearly seen from age 60. Overall rates were higher for men but there were not marked sex differences in cohort mortality trends (data not shown).

Conclusions: The birth cohort effect we observed is consistent with a proportion of IPF cases being due to an occupational or environmental exposure with latency and further research is needed. 

The recent publication of the INPULSIS­1, INPULSIS­2, and ASCEND trials mean that meaningful
treatment for patients with IPF beyond palliation or lung transplantation is an emergent possibility.
But for a history of asbestos exposure, IPF and Asbestosis may produce a clinically identical picture with progressive breathlessness and a Usual
Interstitial Pneumonia on CT or hisotopathologic examination. A history of asbestos exposure may be easily missed and several authors have hypothesised
that a proportion of IPF may be due to occult asbestos exposure.
New antifibrotic treatments for IPF throw the question of whether or not a proportion of IPF is due to occult asbestos exposure into sharp focus; patients
known to have Asbestos Exposure are currently not considered to be candidates for antifibrotic treatments and it may be timely to revisit this.
We present new data obtained from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales on the annual number of deaths due to IPF, Mesothelioma, and
Asbestos for the period 1974­2012 broken down by age, sex, and region. These data show national and regional correlations, and marked sex differences,
which are supportive of the hypothesis that a proportion of IPF is due to Occult Asbestos Exposure and provide motivation for further studies in this area.

Body: Background: It is hypothesised that a proportion of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) cases are due to occult environmental or occupational
exposures to asbestos dust. 
Aims and objectives: To investigate a possible association between IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis mortality consistent with asbestos exposure. To
visualise age­standardised annual mortality trends for IPF, Mesothelioma, and Asbestosis for men and women.
Results: IPF mortality continues to rise. Female:Male is approximately 1:1.6.
