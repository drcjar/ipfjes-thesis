1. summary of what found
- cases and controls heavily asbestos exposed; no significant IPF-asbestos association 
- (association with stone dust; biological plausibility and consistent with previous but numbers small and exposure measure crude)
- association between asbestos exposure and MRC dyspnoea independent of case and smoking status
- asbestos exposure and smoking appear to interact to increase IPF risk; bigger effect in patients with the minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant rs3570950; bigger effect in patients with definite UIP; biggest effect for patients with minor allele of the MUC5b promtotor variant rs3570950 and definite UIP; asbestos exposure alone and smoking alone do not

2. importance
- IPF cases continue to rise; understanding why would help to inform prevention efforts
- globally many are still exposed to asbestos, silica, and smoking
- potentially an unmet need / unmeasured harm presented by asbestos exposed patients with dyspnoea but not diagnosed with IPF
- supports accumulating body of evidence for MUC5b driven pulmonary fibrosis endotype

3. what others have done
- lots of poor quality case control studies, heterogeneity, methodlogical issues esp around selection, small numbers
- metal, wood, stone come out on meta-analysis. asbestos does not not. however methodolgical issues around measurement (and selection), small numbers, and failure to look at interaction might explain
- toxicology and work on genetic risk factors for IPF, RA-ILD, silicosis, asbestosis

4. limitations e.g response rates
- we have only limited data about 

5. strengths: big, properly powered, blinded, asbestos assessment, genetics

7. what we should do next

494 cases and 466 controls were recruited and interviewed. The median age of cases was 76 years and controls 74 years. 97% of cases and 96% of controls reported their ethnicity as white and social economic class and exposure to smoking were similar for cases and controls (see Table 1). Cases were less likely than controls to have ever been prescribed medications known to cause UIP, 15(3%) versus 42(9%) respectively. Cases were more likely than controls to be breathless, Pearson's correlation
coefficient for mMRC dyspnoea and case status was 0.49 (95%CI 0.44-0.53, p<0.001), adjusted OR for was 6.8 (95%CI 5.25-8.8; p<0.001). Cases were also more likely to have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease than controls, 14(2%) versus 2(0.5%), a known association.[@Raghu2006a] After controlling for case and smoking status ever a high or medium risk job for asbestos exposure was associated with dyspnoea, measured using ordinal logistic regression and mMRC dyspnoea score, OR 1.44(1.12-1.84; p=0.004). The strength of association between asbestos exposure and dyspnoea increased with increasing categories of asbestos exposure risk.

Ever being exposed to an occupation at high or medium risk for asbestos exposure was common for both cases (67%) and controls (63%) and the difference in the proportion exposed between cases and controls was not significant (Table four). A similar pattern was observed for categories of exposure (Table five). 8% of cases and controls had estimated cumulative asbestos fibre-ml.year exposures in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years, the Helsinki criteria exposure threshold at which cases of asbestosis may
occur.[@Wolff2015] The majority of these participants had high or medium risk occupations as defined by job title with carpenter being the single most common job title accounting for 5% of all estimates in excess of 25 fibre-ml.years. In an unplanned secondary analysis we also found a significant association self reported occupational exposure to stone dust and IPF, OR 2.9(1.3-6.7; 0.01). 

?Previous studies have found case control studies of IPF have found XYZ. X have looked at asbestos exposure. However they are limited by ABC.

In common with numerous previous studies we found MUC5b rs3570950 to be strongly associated with disease in a risk allele dose-dependant fashion. We found no evidence of interaction between asbestos exposure and MUC5b rs3570950. However, we did find a significant association for having ever smoked, OR 1.4 (95%CI 1-1.8, p < 0.03) and for having ever smoked and having ever had a high or medium asbestos exposure risk based on job title, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p < 0.04). 
Sensitivity analyses including limiting jobs considered to only those that ended before 1980, considering only jobs with a duration greater than 5 years, considering only participants living within 10km of their recruiting hospital, and considering cumulative exposure 'dose' based on summing years in different asbestos exposure risk categories (assigned by job title) at participant level, were all non-significant. 

Cases and controls were well matched and there was no significant association between asbestos exposure, measured by well validated means by job title or by historic asbestos exposure reconstruction, and IPF. There are three main possible explanations for this:

1. Asbestos exposure is not an important cause of IPF
2. Asbestos exposure is only an important cause in concert with other environmental or genetic exposures
3. Asbestos exposure has not been measured accurately enough in IPFJES

8% of cases apparently meet the Helsinki criteria for a diagnosis of asbestosis.[@Wolff2015] This criterion has been criticised for failing to reflect the linear dose-response relationship, and lack of threshold, observed in the published literature.[@Stayner1997][@Hein2007][@Baur2016] Strictly, IPF is a diagnosis of exclusion that should not be made until exposures to asbestos, and other known causes of fibrosis, have been excluded.[@Raghu2011][@Baur2016] Taken to its logical conclusion this line of argument may result in no diagnoses of IPF in the UK since asbestos exposure is ubiquitous; the average asbestos lung burden in men and women without occupational asbestos exposure was recently measured at approximately 1 fibre/mg of lung tissue.[@Gilham2018] In IPFJES the population attributable fraction (PAF) calculated using the adjusted, non-significant, odds ratio (OR) for ever exposed and proportion of cases ever exposed (pc) and the equation: PAF = pc(OR − 1)/OR[@Blanc2019] is about 5%. 

Of note asbestosis is not necessarily fatal[@Doll1985] and may not even be symptomatic since diagnostic criteria require evidence of scarring of the lungs and evidence of asbestos exposure but not the presence of symptoms.[@Wolff2015] In this context a cut off below which exposure is unlikely to cause significant morbidity or mortality seems reasonable. Intriguingly, our results support the concept of asbestos exposure being associated with dyspnoea independent of having IPF and smoking. (?add paul part 1 asbestosis down, part 2 up)

In epidemiological studies the death rate from asbestosis and prevalence of signs and symptoms to it are both higher in cigarette smokers than non-smokers.[@Doll1985] In mouse studies cigarette smoke and asbestos exposure increase the production of reactive oxygen species that are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of asbestosis.[@Liu2013] Asbestos fibres activates NLRP3 inflammasome.[@Morris2015] This is compatible with our observation of an interaction between asbestos exposure, as measured by ever having a job at medium or high risk for asbestos exposure, and ever having smoked on IPF risk, OR 1.9 (95%CI 1.03-3.36, p=0.04). 

I found evidence supporting an interaction between ever smoking and ever having a high or medium risk asbestos exposure job, OR 4.6 (95%CI 1.5-14, p=0.01) when stratifying for genotype, see Table nineteen. It is known that the minor allele of the MUC5b promotor variant, the strongest IPF risk factor, is associated with markedly increased MUC5b expression and that MUC5b is a dominant constituent of the honeycomb cysts that characterise IPF.[@Seibold2013] It is also known
that asbestos exposure activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and results in increased IL-1beta release (as does smoking), and IL-1beta release is a potent stimulus for increased MUC5b expression.[@Dostert2008][@Mossman1998][@Fujisawa2011][@Kuschner1996] This would add to the accumulating evidence for a MUC5b driven pulmonary fibrosis endotype.

There is a precedent for the importance of genetic susceptibility in the development of disease in response to asbestiform fibre inhalation; specifically germline BAP1 mutations were discovered to be important together with eronite exposure in the Cappodecia mesothelioma epidemic.[@Testa2011][@Emri2017] It is possible that there unmeasured genetic modifiers of asbestos exposure risk the presence, or absence, of which is necessary for the development of disease. 

Despite best efforts it is still theoretically possible that my asbestos exposure measure was insufficiently sensitive. Review of all occupational histories by a trained occupational hygeinist blind to the case status of participants would have been desirable but was was prohibitively expensive. It is also possible that the underlying data on which to base historic assessments is not detailed enough to permit sufficiently sensitive assessments by any means.   

Asbestosis can have a latency of upwards of 40 years[@Harding2010] and rates have not yet peaked in the UK.[@HSE2019] From 1900 until around 1960 (see Figure 6.8), when asbestos consumption in the United Kingdom peaked, the United Kingdom had the third highest per capita asbestos consumption in the world with only to the United States and later Australia having higher rates of consumption.[@Allen2017] Our results are likely to generalize well globally where,  with the exception of Brasil, Russian, India, Iran, and China which continue to consume asbestos, consumption has been lower and peaked later.

The main strengths of our study include its size, use of hospital controls, high participation rates and avoidance of non-response bias, the use of two independent validated asbestos exposure assessment instruments, and the assessment of gene-environment interaction. Additionally assessors in IPFJES were blind to case status throughout and the study design and pre-specified outcomes were recorded on clincialtrial.gov (NCT03211507).
